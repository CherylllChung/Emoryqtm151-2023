2023-01-27 12:57:42.767,10A,,BBA with Economics minor,Sophomore,White,Both,"The mission of Emory Impact Investing Group speaks to both my roots and values. In the late 1940s, my great-grandfather, with my teenage grandmother, started a small business in New York City. They arrived in the United States as refugees with limited education and no money. I credit their hard work for their success, but equally credit the support they received from family and strangers. I understand the importance of supporting and protecting small businesses in need, which is why I greatly welcome the opportunity to participate in EIIG. I care deeply about the struggle that small businesses face, particularly those in immigrant and minority communities. If not for organizations such as EIIG, many small businesses would not launch, nor survive their early years, losing an opportunity for individuals to support themselves, their families and their communities. I am eager to connect with like minded individuals who share a common passion for making a meaningful impact in communities in need. I believe being a member of EIIG will not only allow me to connect with like minded students, but also hone leadership skills and provide valuable insight into issues affecting underserved areas in Atlanta. ","The impact that COVID has had on minority communities, including minority owned small businesses, is hard to comprehend and devastating to witness. I firsthand witnessed these struggles this past summer as an intern at UA3 Community First Food Pantry, a food bank in Lower Manhattan largely serving an East Asian immigrant population. Much of my work was physical labor, unloading trucks and carrying food supplies for the lines of hungry clients. I distributed food, as well as other tasks needed, such as managing crowds and sorting items. This experience opened my eyes to the impact that COVID, and poverty in general, has on many Americans, especially minority populations. I enjoyed the camaraderie of my co-workers, the clients we served and the knowledge that we made a significant impact on each person we assisted. The loaves of bread I handed out each day gave them a means to support their families. Seeing peoples’ struggles and desperation for essentials that I often take for granted, was enlightening. In small ways, I found opportunities to improve the flow of food to our clients; I helped re-organize the food storage area and brought a small amount of order to the lines of people. This experience was truly fulfilling and I plan to continue similar volunteer activities in the future. ","I worked as a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp my summer after senior year of high school, by the far the most responsibility I had ever had in my life. I supervised younger children, who challenged me on a daily basis to be a more emphatic and patient person. One camper, in particular, struggled with separation anxiety. He was entirely fixated on missing his parents. Nothing worked; the camp even discussed sending him home. In order to distract and comfort him, I suggested we play Candy Land. I made sure to “reorganize” the deck so that every card he would draw would help him advance, and ultimately win the game. Following each of his victories in Candy Land, a game which he somehow never lost, he felt safer and came further out of his shell, eventually easing his way into a successful summer away from home and parents. ","I have been fortunate to have had a close relationship with all four of my grandparents. Both of my paternal grandparents were Holocaust survivors; their experiences both during and after World War II have formed an integral part of my values. My grandfather, at the age of 90, continues to live a full life, including working five days a week. His optimism, work ethic and decency in the face of all the hardships he has experienced is an inspiration to me. As a grandchild of Holocaust survivors, I feel a special obligation to do my part to heal the world. I have learned indirectly from my family how much suffering there is in the world and how small acts of kindness can make a huge difference in people's lives, sometimes even impacting life and death.",,4.45,0.688,1.018,
2023-01-25 14:49:32.666,11A,,Economics and Finance,Freshman,Asian,Both,"During virtually every summer break, I phonebanked for local political campaigns, hearing the stories of numerous small business owners who struggled to stay afloat. The callers would recount how painful it was to shut down their dream business venture due to a lack of foot traffic or would talk about how COVID-19 completely changed their interactions with previous customers; however, I wasn’t able to offer any meaningful advice. I could only continue with rehearsed statements on how our candidate’s policies would “lift up small businesses”. 

What does that actually mean, though? 

Thinking back, I wish I’d been able to provide tangible help to those small business owners, rather than just relying on false promises from politicians. This is why I’m so passionate about what EIIG does: providing support and equal access to economic opportunity to often-neglected business owners through short-term microloans.

I’m looking forward to driving down to Atlanta, meeting with hardworking owners, and going over their weekly transactions. Whether it be through helping to boost businesses’ social media presence or through creating a detailed proposal on how they can decrease their expenses, I’m excited to brainstorm potential solutions with a team of fellow Emory students.

Being from Atlanta, I’m able to provide a unique perspective of what Georgians look for when they go out, and I could help make real, substantive change in the Atlanta business community through EIIG.
","“You have a good heart, so I trust that you won’t find yourself here again…” 

With that, the judge solemnly smacked her gavel against her desk. Almost instantly, I could see the color rush back into Jacob’s face, grateful to be given another chance by the law. 

As a mentor for The Learning Club, an educational program helping young defendants convicted of misdemeanors to evolve and not re-offend, I led numerous thought-provoking discussions building a tight bond with students like Jacob. Our weekly zoom calls opened my eyes to how truly consequential the program was, surrounding our students with a safe community of driven peers who also want to rise above their past mistakes. 

Because I was the same age as my students, I was able to uniquely connect with their fears about high school and college in ways older mentors could not. I helped them discover their passions and create goals for their futures. On a tour of the High Museum of Art, Jacob was able to unearth his love for graphic design and animation. At a robotics seminar, our guest speaker sparked an interest in Mark to learn more about coding and a career in engineering.

Ultimately, I’m determined to continue fighting for students just like Jacob who are suddenly faced with the daunting task of maturing while also having to deal with the deeply personal issues that initially pushed them to commit that consequential crime: debt, dysfunctional families, bullying, and more. 
","“The Horrors of School Bathrooms,” I said to my school administrators, sliding issues of my satirical article into their mailboxes.

Like every other US high school, mine struggled with trashed bathrooms and empty soap dispensers. However, in my senior it went too far – most stalls didn’t have doors. When we protested against damaged facilities, we were met with “we’ll look into this later” and dismissive shrugs. Knowing our concerns weren’t taken seriously, I decided to write a satirical article for my school’s newspaper, detailing how preposterous it was that we were expected to use doorless bathrooms, and share it around campus. 

Though our bathrooms weren’t totally fixed after I published the article, it helped to stir up more anger against our administrators, prompting them to finally get doors installed on all bathroom stalls. It wasn’t a perfect solution, but it helped to bring attention to an important issue for students.
","Scrunched-up, crowded lines of elderly grandparents filling up the parking lot of a small makeshift hospital was my view every time I came to the TAMA Clinic. 

I volunteered at a pop-up clinic headed by local doctors who wanted to provide free check-ups to uninsured Indian immigrants who were in desperate need of medical attention. Every Saturday, I learned of patients’ negative experiences with healthcare in America. Each story affected me as these people, after working so hard, weren’t being treated adequately; however, I didn’t want to devolve into nihilism and instead channeled my anger toward pushing for healthcare reform.

Though I’ve gotten more involved with politics since then, I’m still ultimately driven by my time at the TAMA Clinic as I saw how patients accepted that they’d have to line up in a parking lot every time their back hurts instead of being treated with dignity in a hospital.

2023-01-27 11:32:56.635,12A,,Business,Freshman,White,Both,"Small businesses have made an enormous impact on my life. In the Town of North Castle, where I live, there is a rule that no chain businesses are allowed to exist. When I tell people that I never had Starbucks on a regular basis growing up or that the closest Chick-fil-A is a 30-minute drive from my house, they are shocked. However, this means that the small businesses in my town hold a very special place in my heart. Every morning, I go into Tazza, our local coffee shop, greet James, the owner, and ask him how his day has been. Every few weeks, my family heads to dinner at our local pizzeria, Amore, and we catch up with our server, Sammy, who has been working there since I was three years old. Small, local businesses mean so much to me, and I would love nothing more than to help close the micro-business gap here in Atlanta. The mission of EIIG, the immense social impact this organization makes in our community, and the connection between the members that I saw at the BBA Club Fair and the Interest Meeting make me want to join EIIG. The chance to have the same relationship with an entrepreneur at a small business in Atlanta and help them grow their business with a loan, as I do with the owners of small businesses back home, is why I want to join EIIG.","I am immensely passionate about helping people with disabilities. In a unique class in high school called Global Scholars, I created a three-year action plan for my school district that addresses students with disabilities and their inferior access to education during the pandemic. During COVID, students without disabilities learned through in-person and online synchronous lessons. However, when students with disabilities, like my sister, could not physically attend school, their online live instruction was limited. To address this inequity, I created an action plan which raised awareness on social media. I also built a website to teach students with disabilities how to access the resources available to them. Through this project, I played a role in helping my sister and other students like her receive more equitable learning opportunities. In addition, an activity that holds an extremely special place in my heart was volunteering at Gigi’s Playhouse, an organization that pursues inclusion and acceptance while providing resources for individuals with Down syndrome. By working with the kids at Gigi’s Playhouse during cooking classes, dance classes, and conversational sessions, I have been exposed to a host of new people with spirited personalities and many ideas to share with the world. I have become more patient and understanding and have gained a greater appreciation for these amazing people, many of whom remind me of my sister, who also has Down syndrome. It is incredibly rewarding to connect with individuals with so much to offer and an exceptional amount of love to give.","As part of the Sustainability Initiative Club in high school, I needed to help figure out how to increase awareness and sustainable practices in a way that wouldn’t bore the elementary school students and wouldn’t be ignored by the high schoolers. For the elementary schools, I came up with the idea to do book read-alouds for books about recycling. To make it engaging, we had their favorite teachers read the books, and we created fun worksheets with coloring pages and word searches. For the high schoolers, we knew that they wouldn’t pay attention to most presentations or videos, so we had to do something creative. To solve the recycling problem, we gave candy to students who could correctly identify the bins in which a few pieces of garbage would go. Creative thinking was the only way to solve this problem, and we saw results within the next few months!","There are many wonderful and rewarding parts of having a sibling with a disability. Belonging to a community of siblings of people who have disabilities is an integral part of my identity. I get the extraordinary opportunity to help improve someone else’s life on a daily basis. During my internship at includeNYC, an organization that provides equity and resources for children with special needs, I wrote an article as part of a series on siblings about what it is like to have a sister with a disability. After reading other pieces in the series, I felt deeply connected to this larger group of people who have similar experiences. I look forward to meeting others like me and aspire to continue developing my relationship with this community. Having a sister with a disability has not only enhanced my adaptability, responsibility, and tolerance, but has also bonded me to this incredible community.",,5.0,0.797,1.488,
2023-01-27 01:23:25.660,13A,,"Sociology, AMS",Sophomore,Asian,Both,"The main aspect that draws me to EIIG is how much its members care about the entrepreneurs’ lives and their passions rather than just the numbers on the page that represent the business. While it is clear to me that EIIG operates with prudence; loaning money to qualified companies that will find success and repay their debts, I am drawn to the intrinsic beauty of EIIG giving authentic hope to entrepreneurs in our community. Throughout this recruitment process, I have gotten to hear incredible stories about how EIIG members have opened doors for businesses to flourish. For example, Camila told me about a time they pivoted away from their presentation plans to comforting and motivating a client, acutely recognizing what their clients needed.

Seeing the care exhibited by EIIG members reminds me that I am still searching for a community on campus where I can fully commit my time as a servant leader in a practical way. I have yet to find a professional community at Emory that aligns with my philosophy, but I think that EIIG is the organization where I can explore freely and serve others around me. I have gotten to meet with members like Cathrine who shared about her being able to diverge into multiple roles to find her passion. Even in these short moments, I was able to have meaningful conversations with EIIG members, and I can only imagine how much more we could accomplish if I could join this organization. ","Coming from China, I attended a boarding school named McCallie in the US. While the journey was a memorable one, it did not begin on a high note: I realized that misunderstandings between international and domestic students are caused when subtle linguistic nuances are lost in translation. Therefore, to clear out those misconceptions, I decided to take on the challenge to connect the gaps by founding the Culture Exchange Club. This club would connect equal numbers of international and American students (either day or boarding students) by coordinating bonding activities—having a meal, hiking—allowing usually separate groups to have a chance to listen to respective cultures and life experiences. I saw these times of sharing joy, effort, success, or even failure breaking down the wall of differences. They allow everyone to overcome their distinct identities, providing a space for participants to present their true selves and learn about others as well.
           
I consider this activity my most important impact, not only because it facilitated the relations between the international and American communities at my school, but also because it was my first step towards personally understanding others from different backgrounds. Through this introspection, some of my fellow Chinese students were able to better articulate their reasons for coming to America as well, which gave them a sense of purpose and motivation. These interactions have allowed them to gain a greater understanding of how Chinese culture has shaped who they are in light of their experiences in America.","Last year, I helped my friend Logan from high school to increase production efficiency for his kickstart custom-made-to-order coin company. He grew his business to an annual sale of $100k after the first year of his business. He was quickly overwhelmed by the number of orders per day, especially during the Christmas season, when he had almost 200 orders placed a day, and each order takes 5 minutes for him just to prepare for production. I quickly identified the problem- he had the ambition to ship the orders in 2-3 days, but he simply did not have enough workforce, as he works solely on his own. Instead of hiring costly labor, I contacted a freelance coder on Fiverr.com to design a simple program that cut the preparation time to just one minute. The freelancer only cost us $100. Now, Logan can ship all his orders on time. ","The motto that “Man’s chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him Forever.” is omnipresent on my high school campus. That purpose overwhelmed a 15-year-old Chinese boy who was confined to an atheistic environment. I was anxious, wondering if serving God is my sole purpose. 

I began to ask questions, a lot of questions. I navigate answers in Chinese and foreign literature and history; I am also open to the life experiences of people around me. I now transform cultural conflicts into opportunities for growth. At Emory, I keep my curiosity by asking “whys” to reach my purpose. At RUF, I reflect on my faith by listening to others’ relationships with it; at the Wheel, I try to examine and understand the rationality of the organization and collect my thoughts more clearly by asking myself and the organizations “whys” behind each decision.

2023-01-27 10:56:23.706,14A,,BBA/MSBA ,Freshman,Asian,Both,"Throughout my childhood, I spent my summers working at my family’s restaurants in Jersey City. I engaged in every displeasing aspect of the family business, from plunging the toilet to dealing with unsatisfied customers. But in retrospect, all the late nights I spent, the accounting sheets I filled out, and inventory slips I sent formulated my passion for something greater than just rinsing dirty plates.

We were financially devastated when the pandemic shut down my family’s restaurant. Out of necessity, we laid off many longtime workers, downsized our infrastructure, and began closing temporarily for weeks at a time.

As the effects of the pandemic began to alleviate, we required working capital to jump-start our small family restaurant back to normal conditions. Thankfully, we started working with the US Small Business Association for guidance. My father and I tirelessly prepared our business case and financial statements. Within weeks, we were granted our small business loan and multiple dedicated advisors to help us. Continuing my interests, I interned with a local branch of SCORE, a volunteer small business mentoring organization.

Researching, I realized the process that we experienced with the SBA was similar (applying, due diligence, interviews, etc.), but EIIG’s was on a more personal level. Without the aid of the SBA, our family restaurant would have never returned to full capacity, and for that, I am extremely grateful. I am excited to explore how my experience as both a small business owner and helper can translate to helping entrepreneurs with EIIG.","Growing up across the street from a fire department, I fascinatedly stared out the window as firetrucks blazed out of the station as a child. My obsession lingered throughout my childhood. I finally began volunteering in an administrative manner at the age of fourteen, manning events, cleaning the engine bay, fundraising, and learning bits of firefighting as I went. Although it did not seem like much, my dreams of becoming a firefighter pushed me over the next three years.

When I turned seventeen, I instantly enrolled in the fire academy and began the eight-month-long process. As an immature seventeen-year-old, I was forced to grow up quickly, but the lessons I received were invaluable. I learned all of the facets of firefighting in addition to the characteristics of a strong team. Clear communication, personal accountability, adaptability, and problem-solving were demanded out of every firefighter and essential to the job.

After graduating, I was immediately placed into a truck company responsible for protecting towns throughout Central New Jersey. I took advantage of my gap semester working part-time as a firefighter. Working on the weekends and nights, I saw the very worst that New Jersey had to offer: fatal car accidents on I-95, apartment fires, gas leaks, industrial accidents, and more. 

Although I could talk about the lives that I saved, the real impact my firefighting had was on me. Firefighting turned me from that hopeful child to a passionate, independent person who finally proved to himself that he could make meaningful change.","When I was young, my family owned two guinea pigs. When it was warm enough, we let them out to roam throughout our backyard, but one morning, they both got out of their enclosure and into the suburban wildlands of Central Jersey.

Looking for a solution, I devised a comprehensive plan. I created a circular perimeter a mile wide, leaving food with a strong scent every quarter mile along the circumference of the circle. The circle was then split into ten smaller circles, with an increasingly desirable treat on the circumference of each smaller circle. In the center of it all was my home, possessing the most desirable treat, a pound of celery sticks in a cage ready to trap anything that set foot in it. To our relief, the very next week, the guinea pigs were back in their enclosure, never to escape again.","Running has been a constant in my life since I was a toddler, and I am fortunate to be able to continue it at Emory. During the summers, I jokingly started a Popsicle Club, a running club that served popsicles to incentivize teammates to grow their fitness.

Sessions were daily, and our team got incredibly close over the course of a month. One day, a teammate brought his father to run as a joke. We all played along, enjoying his company, but slowly, everyone bought their family and friends. By the next summer, we welcomed everyone from toddlers to senior citizens. Our group was incredibly diverse, with people of all socioeconomic backgrounds, races, and origins, but running unified us all. Spending time with people of different cultures allowed me to learn about my community. Although I am more than a run away, I still think of my Popsicle Club daily.",,4.75,0.744,1.223,
2023-01-27 13:12:55.421,15A,,"Finance, ISOM, Sociology",Freshman,Asian,Both,"The notion of socially responsible capitalism, and uplifting people economically has always been rooted within my interests and identity. While this form of capitalism seems contradictory, I am a big proponent of the idea that business as a field should not only emphasize its responsibility to serve as benefactors, but also drive the economy, from large corporations to small businesses. This mindset was the product of a long withstanding history in my family, who, as immigrants who recently arrived in the U.S., worked for an array of small businesses, and even started their own, yet struggled to adapt to this new environment as they often lacked the money, pedigree, and an understanding of economic concepts and business strategy. While prevalent, these issues aren’t exclusive to immigrants; many small businesses fail after ten years for the same, or similar reasons. 

Yet EIIG’s mission to gradually uplift micro businesses through advisory and loans ensures that this perpetual issue is gradually being diminished. EIIG follows a theme of utilizing business concepts and strategies, combined with an entrepreneurial mindset to economically uplift those that need it. I was able to engage in this practice as well when I served as an intern for the SFPUC and conducted research on the economic impacts of financial bailouts, or when I used social media marketing techniques to spread awareness for the organization Impact Justice. As a potential member, I am excited to continue this path of conscious business ventures. ","Last year, while working with the Homegoing Project, a re-entry program for formerly incarcerated individuals, I became deeply aware of the systemic issues surrounding mass incarceration and the lack of empathy towards those who are incarcerated. Through my interactions with Tiffany, a woman in a Bay Area detention center, I gained a firsthand understanding of the dire conditions in which incarcerated individuals were living during the pandemic, including being denied vaccinations and being housed with sick inmates.

Last year, in an effort to learn more about systemic issues relating to mass incarceration and apathy toward incarcerated people, my English teacher and I partnered with the Homegoing Project through the non-profit Impact Justice to reach out to local and out of state prisons to inquire about their COVID-19 protocols and vaccine distribution efforts. By speaking with incarcerated individuals through letters, I was able to serve as a communicator between inmates and administrators. I called wardens of prisons in several states where the issue of safety was especially worrisome, and expressed the concerns of inmates of how unsafe and dangerous conditions were causing spikes in COVID cases within prisons. In addition, I served as a representative within my school and enabled other students to get involved as well. Through working with the Homegoing Project, I’ve come to understand the value of not only speaking up for people who are generally disregarded, but also encouraging others to raise awareness as well. 
","In addition to providing utilities services to Bay Area Residents, the SFPUC strived to connect with local communities, educating them on the importance of environmental issues, a goal that I believed to be important. Yet during the COVID-19 pandemic, the SFPUC abruptly cancelled all its tours to local organizations. 

To help the SFPUC continue to motivate San Francisco residents learn about environmental solutions during the pandemic, I decided to create a film to teach others about the implementation of environmental systems and to evoke discussions about the relevance of environmental policies on social justice. I reached out to the General Manager and Director of Media, who both advised me on how I could integrate what they wanted in the video with my vision. Finally, after weeks of filming and editing, I was able to complete and publish the film, which would later be shown to local SF organizations during the pandemic. 
","From my early childhood, I had always felt distant from my grandfather. Given our language barrier, there had always been a rift in our relationship—everything I heard about him, I heard secondhand. Yet an opportunity arose when my parents recommended that I interview him for a school project with my uncle as a translator. Despite my initial apprehensions, as we began talking, 

With every story, I felt as though a new facet of my grandfather’s values, culture, and history was being illuminated, instilling within me the importance of storytelling and interpersonal connections. While my relationship with him is far from perfect, I’ve found the development of our conversations and stories to be invaluable as they imbued me with qualities of compassion, empathy, and identity.

I want to be a part of EIIG because I am passionate about evening out this scale, and EIIG’s mission attempts to do just that.  Last semester, I took a class that discussed the economics of systemic racism; here I learned why disparities persist in our society today. I learned about redlining as well as reverse redlining, both tactics used to promote financial inequality within the African American Community. Seeing the feedback loops that these actions have taken in our society opened my eyes to how wealth disparity arose from the actions of an unjust system. I believe in this group’s mission as it is crucial not only from a moral perspective but as a necessity for our economy. Helping these businesses in low-income areas, helps the local economy by offering jobs to people who really need them, providing local products, and supporting services. These microloans help support these microbusinesses in high-poverty areas that need support to bridge the gap as a result of the Jim Crow Era. ","Two summers ago, I served as an intern at New York City Councilmember Carlos Menchaca’s office. Carlos Menchaca is the head of the Immigration Committee as well as the first Mexican American elected to NYC’s public offices. During my time in Menchaca’s office, I focused on NYC’s Excluded Worker Fund, which was a $2.1 billion fund providing cash payments to those ineligible for state unemployment benefits or federal COVID-related relief funds, many of whom were undocumented immigrants. I will never forget a certain EWF applicant one morning. A Dominican woman had walked through the office doors speaking minimal English and rapid-fire Spanish.  As a person who used to struggle to comprehend Spanish when it is spoken quickly, my heart started to race. Despite my initial anxiety, I was able to converse with her fluently and address her needs. That day I spent most of the morning helping her complete the EWF application and assisting her with her citizenship petition. She told me that she was never able to complete it on her own due to her fear of getting rejected or not being able to understand it. As I helped her, I was filled with  a sense of pride  as I remembered that my father went through the exact same citizenship process a few years before and how it positively impacted my family. I am thrilled to say that this woman, whose name is Ana, successfully received the EWF funds and is on her way to receiving her citizenship.","As part of a business elective at school, I competed in the Junior Achievement Business Plan Competition, which judges high schoolers’ start-ups. This year, participants needed to target a pandemic-related issue through their startup. I had seen how the pandemic had affected my friend’s mental health and I wanted to create something to help them. I planned to develop a social media platform to target mental health issues. The app would target mental illness through a judgment-free zone and utilize daily check-ins, a friendship-making algorithm with other users, and access to mental health professionals. I was able to build a mock trial of this application with the help of my engineering teacher and my fellow classmates said they found it less overwhelming than the popular social media platforms circulating now.","I come from a traditional Hispanic family, being half Dominican and Ecuadorian. Being the daughter of immigrants I learned how to be an advocate, as I have had to act as one since I was a child. I have always wanted to serve as a voice for the voiceless, seeing my parents struggle through the immigration process and also facing racism myself in my predominantly white town. My parents sacrificed a lot to come to this country and even more when they had me and I have always worked towards making their sacrifice worth it. Seeing the persistent social issues in my life, from colorism in my own family to racism from my own peers altered my mindset into becoming solution-driven.

EIIG’s mission to close the micro-business gap in high poverty areas offers a stellar opportunity to explore the cultural and economic history of the under-represented communities in Atlanta. I want to join EIIG because I am passionate about the micro-lending space within the financial spectrum.

I have previously been involved in this space, through my internship at Utkarsh Small Finance Bank, a micro-lending organization based in India, where I investigated how the outreach of microfinance can lead to long-term financial inclusion in the country, which can be used to create businesses and ultimately build income streams for low income families. This internship led me into unexplored avenues of the several networks necessary for the sustainable growth of businesses, and I am excited to continue my inclusion in this sphere by working closing with the team at EIIG. 

The mentorship and operations at EIIG will guide me through the structured world of micro-lending and impact investing, and ensconced within EIIG’s dynamic collaborative environment and culture of innovative problem solving, I can see myself excel and contribute to positively assist the Atlanta community around us.","Setting up a new club in my high school seemed simple. The thought that it would be a Financial Literacy club, made the process seem even easier. 

I wanted to build a community of financial enthusiasts, but due to the absence of a Finance teacher in my school, the club would have to be student-led. While pitching the idea to my high school administration, they were hesitant to grant authorization due to this very reason. I had already spent countless nights gathering resources that covered diverse topics on financial literacy. These resources would have acted as a gateway to finance for the younger students in my school. However, the school administration initially failed to notice the potential my idea possessed. It has now been a couple years since this incident and the experience has expanded my intellectual boundaries, leading to learnings far beyond the initial challenges faced while creating the club. The countless nights and multiple calls with my co-founders has now resulted in one of the most successful clubs at my highschool, one that regularly participates in case competitions, and has recently tasted great success. 

Through this experience, I have learnt that passion and determination - though might be doubted in the beginning - has the capability of creating change. At EIIG, I hope to make healthy relationships and building formidable friendships with my peers, to channel my time and assist others in an equitable and compassionate manner.","While I wouldn't necessarily call this a problem, I notice that this question has not been marked as 'required'. My way of creatively expressing myself to solve this so-called 'problem' is this answer to the question.","Hindu religion believes that our lives comprise 4 stages and the final stage of renunciation is one when individuals renounce all material possessions and detach themselves from society, which underscores the premise that nothing we possess is truly our own. I have learned the importance of giving back to make my community a better place.

Drawing on the teaching imparted by my upbringing and being privileged enough to have a global outlook imbued by an international education, I strive to give back by extending myself beyond the classroom to help my community, such as volunteering with non-profits such as the Robinhood Army. My Hindu culture has inculcated beliefs within me that shape my personality, and at EIIG, I wish to engage with like-minded students and uplift the lives of individuals in traditionally high poverty areas by helping increase the number of successful small businesses.",,4.625,0.72,1.137,
2023-01-27 12:16:04.134,18A,,Business - OAM; ENVS Minor,Freshman,Multiracial,Both,"EIIG’s mission of supporting small businesses in low-income areas is at the intersection of my service experience, career interests, and personal values. Serving my community has always been important to me—in highschool, I worked in local middle schools to help fight for education equity, and now in college I’ve been working on financial literacy education programs to eventually bring into local high schools. The service work I’ve done has been mostly in education, but as a business student I’d like to branch out and combine my service work with my field of study. I see EIIG as a perfect opportunity for this. As an analyst, the first-hand consulting experience would teach me useful professional skills, while I continue to do socially impactful work. Although I lack prior experience in this field, the EIIG community seems like a supportive group, looking to help everyone improve in their work. EIIG’s work is truly what I’m passionate about; I see the group as a place where I can not only be part of a learning community that promotes professional development, but also where I can make an impact on those around me.","Over the past four years, I worked as a tutor for local, underprivileged Oakland middle schoolers through a program called Partners. As a Partners mentor during the academic year, I had weekly, one-on-one sessions with a mentee to help with homework, organizational skills, and test prep. Through the sessions, my mentees were able to get my undivided attention—something they weren’t always able to get from their teachers during class. They had the freedom to ask any questions they wanted and get immediate, personalized responses and help. During the summer, I taught math and high school readiness classes to the same group of students. Having worked with this program throughout my whole time in high school, I not only gained meaningful work experience and skills, but more importantly built lifelong connections. I started my work looking to do something I’m passionate about and try to make an impact on my surrounding communities, but I didn’t realize how meaningful the connections I made along the way would be. Both my coworkers and my mentees shaped my experience as a mentor, and have made lasting impacts on me. For me, building deep connections with those you’re working with, especially over long periods of time, is truly special. To this day, I still keep in touch with many people from the program, my former students included—whenever I talk to one of them, get a text, or anything in between, I feel like I made an impact and am thankful for their impact on me. ","After all the years of school that I’ve gone through, I’ve learned that everybody has a unique learning style. For me, this realization has been extremely helpful when working as a teacher. Oftentimes, when teaching math, especially to younger students, problems can be hard to conceptualize. What I might see as a simple equation for a line can seem much more complex to my student. Thus, creative expression and adaptability is necessary. The first example of this that comes to mind is from when I had just started one-on-one tutoring. My student and I had a lot of shared interests, especially basketball. So, when a problem came around he struggled to understand, I would transform it into one that he could relate to. Instead of just variables, I made it Stephen Curry scoring points per minutes—he understood it better, and I felt like my problem solving made a real difference.","Being raised in an immigrant community has greatly shaped my values. My mom’s family immigrated to the United States from India in the 70’s, looking to give future generations a better life. When my grandparents arrived here, they did everything they could to set their children, and future grandchildren, up for success. They prided themselves on hard work and perseverance; years later, when I was born, they would instill those same values in me. Being around my grandparents, aunties and uncles, family-friends from the village back in India, I learned to work hard and take nothing for granted. To sum up the impact, every year on my birthday my grandpa would give me a card reading: “hard work pays off.” As simple as it sounds, it’s important to me—I remember his message when times are tough. I know that my hard work is making him, and my whole family proud.",,4.5625,0.706,1.062,

I've learned firsthand that working with local small businesses enables you to see the real, substantial results of your actions- something that working with larger corporations doesn't offer.
 
In high school, I volunteered with James Storehouse, a small nonprofit local to my area that benefits foster families through sorting community donations of clothes and houseware. While working, I became close friends with its founders, and loved how over time they shared their vision and process with me. EIIG is the best way for me to continue that experience at Emory.

As a member, I have so many options for what I want to get involved in. As a first-year, I haven’t fully decided what facet of business I want to pursue, so EIIG’s range in operations is exciting. As an analyst, EIIG could help me get a taste of consulting, risk analysis, finance, and others. Additionally, talking with Kathy, Edmond, Jonathan, and others has proven to me that members are friendly, passionate, and form close bonds within the club.

EIIG will allow me to continue to help small, often minority-owned businesses while learning skills that will help me in my future career in business. I’m a fast learner, and believe I have the teamwork skills and creativity necessary to work effectively.  Most of all, I want to get to know clients and find out how I can help. I would love to join your team.","In high school, I volunteered with James Storehouse, a small nonprofit local to my area that benefits foster families. While I was originally interested because my brother and sister are adopted as well, I personally got to know James Storehouse’s founders and their vision of easing the overburdened foster care system in my county. As I was approaching the end of my journey in Boy Scouts, I was inspired to do my culminating Eagle Scout service project with them: fundraising and assembling twin beds for foster children. 

Every child entering the foster care system must have their own bed before moving in.  Most foster families don't have an extra bed to give, and therefore look for help to find one. With this need in mind, I raised over $1500 from the community and then led a team of 30 to assemble 15 beds and 15 no-sew blankets for foster children in need. Ultimately, the project was a huge success, and within months every bed had been donated to a child waiting in the foster care process.

However, the real reward for me wasn't finally completing my Eagle Scout requirements, but rather a chance meeting with one of the foster children I donated a bed to while volunteering months later. Seeing my work have a tangible impact on someone else was indescribable. At EIIG, I hope to continue that work to support our clients, who have a vision for their business just like I had for my project.","I was a member of Junior State of America in high school, a nationwide student-led organization fusing constructive debate and mock government. While I joined because of my interests in debate and politics, I got involved in my state’s leadership and was elected Director of Fundraising in 2021. The fundraising team’s job was raising money to help fund scholarships for our overnight regional conventions, which are the heart of the club. While most of our income came from donations and membership fees, I wanted to revitalize the merch stand that sold stickers and apparel at conventions. Using CustomInk and my (passable) graphic design skills, I created some JSA-themed clothing and sticker designs parodying hypedbrands like Supreme and Off-White. These were a hit at conventions, and in that year we raised over $2,000 from clothing alone. I’m glad I had that opportunity to see the results of my creativity.","I was a part of Boy Scouts for most of my teenage years. Being a closeted gay teen in a traditionalist, patriotic and “manly” organization like Scouts led to a lot of self-questioning and doubt growing up. While my group was accepting when I came out, I still dealt with silent homophobia and feeling out of place.

Despite these challenges, I’ve looked back at my years in Scouts and realized the value in the time I spent camping with friends or volunteering. I value the leadership opportunities I had, and the chance to be a role model to younger members. I learned how to creatively problem solve, work with people I disagree with, and a self-sufficiency that has helped me adjust to college life. I was able to find a community in my Boy Scouts troop, and I believe it was the match that lit my passion for service and leadership.",,4.5,0.697,1.059,

Growing up, I have always been enthusiastic about investing. EIIG provides me with opportunities to further develop such passion, and apply the knowledge I learned at school in a real-world setting, helping businesses improve and provide solutions to them. I'm excited about the opportunity of working with the management team and witnessing the business's growth trajectory, as such things bring me a sense of fulfillment like no other. 

Additionally, as the only club at Goizueta combining consulting with finance paths, EIIG is where I can encounter people with diverse backgrounds and learn in an interdisciplinary setting. I look forward to collaborating with high-caliber peers with different skill sets and developing my technical knowledge via conducting financial due diligence or implementing consulting recommendations.

Last but not least, I am drawn to the inclusive community at EIIG. EIIG is the only club I followed which members frequently spend weekends and holidays together. As an international student studying in this country alone, I'm not only looking for a club where I can develop my professional skills, but a community where I can feel a sense of belonging. I'm confident that EIIG is the place that suits me. Overall, EIIG aligns with my personal and professional values and is a place where I can explore my passion and meet like-minded people. 
","One project that I am particularly passionate about was a film I made with a group of like-minded people. We all shared a passion for film-making and storytelling, and decided to collaborate on a short film that discussed the gender discrimination issue, which we felt strongly about. 

The project was a huge undertaking; we all had to wear multiple hats and work together to see it through. I served as the director and lead producer - I was responsible for managing the budget, coordinating the team, and ensuring that the final product was up to our standards. It was challenging, but I loved every minute of it. The film was well received and was shown at a local film festival and entered the finalist. It was a great feeling to see our hard work recognized and appreciated by others. More importantly, the film served as a powerful tool for raising awareness and starting conversations about the issue we had tackled. It was an amazing experience, and I felt like I had a tangible impact on the community.

This project was important to me because it allowed me to combine my passion for filmmaking with my desire to make a difference in the world. It was also a great opportunity to learn new skills and to work with a talented and dedicated team. Overall, it was a project that I will always remember and be proud of.","One way I have been able to express myself creatively to solve a problem was through drama poster design. I was tasked with creating a poster for a school play with a limited budget and needed to attract a diverse audience. I decided to focus on the play's theme of individuality and used a collage approach with a combination of photographs and illustrations that depicted the core character and elements of the play.

After careful consideration, I decided to use the silhouette of one of the female characters to create a silent but powerful picture that is also visually attractive to people. The play's poster helped to attract more than expected audience to the play as the simplicity made it stand out.

This experience taught me that by thinking about the core message and theme of a play and expressing myself creatively, I could come up with a unique and effective solution for drama poster design. It also taught me to be creative and never be restricted in my future career. ","One of the communities that shaped my personality was the TedTalk club I joined during high school. Growing up in a conservative culture that discouraged individuals, especially females, from speaking their minds, I struggled with confidence in expressing my opinions in public. However, my experience with the TedTalk club changed that.

I was drawn to the energy and enthusiasm of its members at a club fair and joined without hesitation. The club members actively helped me improve my public speaking skills, encouraged me to challenge myself, and taught me how to exude confidence. I also worked hard to practice my skills at every opportunity and even took on the challenge of competing in club events. With the help of those members, I gradually became more assertive in my thoughts and opinions. The TedTalk club has become integral to my identity, and I will always hold it dear to my heart.",,4.0,0.592,0.55,

EIIG’s commitment to assist entrepreneurs of small businesses who are unable to access resources and develop business plans perfectly aligns with my passion for community. EIIG’s goal of supporting small businesses with potential to grow is motivating to me, and I believe maximizing their fullest potential would lead to a brighter future. Small businesses are just as capable as big businesses, and the mission to reduce the micro-business gap is crucial to bringing growth and innovation to the economy. I have a strong desire to contribute to this mission with my dedication to make a difference in the community and my passion for finance. As part of EIIG, my investment will eventually be able to create a meaningful impact on the community, and as a person who is widely as well as deeply involved in community service, it would motivate me to see the actual impact made upon my team’s investment decision. Alongside my experience improving underserved communities in organizations like Citizen Participatory Innovation Group and Emory Circle K, I have been actively pursuing my career in finance and building foundations in investing. It has been my ultimate desire to find an intersection point of my two interests. EIIG lies on both of my pursuits, and I hope to combine my investing and finance knowledge with my mission to serve the community to boost potential in small businesses, just like lighting a candle.","Last year, while waiting at the crosswalk, I saw a blind person having trouble finding the Accessible Pedestrian Signals (APS) button and not being able to cross the street. It was heartbreaking to see him experiencing inconveniences in society. APS are installed at every crosswalk to help the blind or people with low vision, but I noticed they weren’t effectively put into use, so I applied for an organization that would provide an opportunity to improve current policies by making small changes around me. I joined the Citizen Participatory Innovation Group—an organization that aims to propose innovative ideas to improve the lives of citizens in Seoul. Following several field-research and meetings, I submitted an idea for installing voice recognition devices with APS that notify blind people when to cross without themselves having to press the button. Instead of having to find the button, visually impaired individuals can simply say a word or sentence. My proposal was well-received and is currently under the process of developing a sound recognition device that will be part of the whole device. My project is on its way to assisting thousands of visually challenged individuals. I realized that I can make a considerable difference in others’ lives simply by paying attention to day-to-day events unfolding around me, as long as I have the passion. Just like this, I hope to see my contribution making an impact to microbusinesses and the entrepreneurs as part of EIIG.","When faced with a problem, I shift and incorporate different perspectives. I implemented this to bring a unique impact to students in Citizen Participatory Innovation Group. As a youth representative, I was responsible for improving students’ lives, and I discovered newspaper subscriptions at schools aren’t being used effectively. I then put myself in their shoes—I subscribed to newspapers myself and tried searching for articles to aid my own studying. I also incorporated more perspectives by sending out surveys to more students. Analyzing from multiple viewpoints, I discovered it’s difficult to find specifically what students need because newspapers cover such a wide range of topics. As a solution, I proposed providing news articles suited to the school curriculum, classified into each subject. This approach helps me not only understand the problem better but also tackle it with unique solutions that cannot be thought of just from a single, fixed perspective.","It is the supportive Emory community that has greatly shaped my identity. Coming to college, I was faced with multiple struggles making the transition from high school to college, moving to a new country, and balancing social, academic, and career concerns. While making endeavors to overcome these setbacks, I met amazing upperclassmen through my campus involvements. From the very first conversations with them, I was inspired by their commitment and willingness to actively support and offer advice. I have grown a desire to emulate their support and pass down to future underclassmen and peers. I have learned to become a proactive helper, and now I highly value uplifting each other’s development. I hope to maintain this community and impact the underclassmen the same way it did to me, and this value is what I hope to bring to the EIIG community. ",,4.479166666666667,0.693,1.039,

As an international student, Atlanta has become my home in the States since last fall. I am impressed by the vibrant culture here in Atlanta, and I have also noticed the differences between low and high-poverty neighborhoods. I am eager to give back to the community by turning what I learned from the textbook into hands-on practice.

What’s more, EIIG is different from other business clubs at Emory because it helps small businesses propel the implementation after the partnership ends. This is valuable because, for small business owners, their limited resources and history of being underrepresented might impede their efforts. I am thrilled to witness small businesses in Atlanta flourish with our help.

I consider myself a socially responsible person. Before, I gave sexual harassment prevention lectures to local children, and also led a student-run company to produce merchandise and donated our profits to the school charity fund. I am also creative. I wrote scripts for video games that help teenagers identify and react correctly to sexual harassment. I believe that my social responsibility and creativity make me a great fit for EIIG. I am ready to assist small business owners to build their companies and dreams.
","In summer 2021, I started a photography campaign called “4 a.m. in Shanghai”. Together with my teammates, we took photos of blue-collar workers commuting or working at 4 a.m. in Shanghai. My purpose of this campaign is to draw attention to the silent contributors of the city. Shanghai is glamourous, but who wept the fallen leaves on streets, and who drove midnight buses at train stations to take people home? The workers are like veins of the city: they enable our city to operate and function, but are usually underrepresented and ignored.

Using our cameras and drones, we were able to take pictures of them and captured their efforts. I was lucky enough to actually converse with several of them. I was impressed by how hard they worked to make a living in a megacity like Shanghai. I took notes of their stories and posted them on online galleries underneath the photos as annotations. Our small exhibition received great feedback. I would love to continue this campaign here in Atlanta. I want to make it into a collection of different cities worldwide.
","I am proud to say that I am a screenwriter, and I use my stories to deliver my ideas and reflect on our society.

I noticed that many Chinese teenagers, mostly girls, have experienced sexual harassments but didn’t seek help simply because they are not sure what sexual harassments are. Thus, after doing my research, I wrote a script for a video game that aims to help teenagers learn about the identification of sexual harassments and ways to react.

I also wrote a synopsis for a full-length film called Sleepless in Hong Kong, focusing on LGBTQ youth in China. My main characters are two girls in a small town in the south of China in the 1990s. They struggled to make a living after coming to Hong Kong while maintaining their relationship despite of the objection and pressure from the overall homophobic social norm. 
","Being a feminist has shaped my identity. Growing up, I have noticed an unignorable difference in social expectations towards men and women. In China, many women have to work as hard as men in workplaces while taking care of their families, doing chores and bringing up their children. I want to help share their burden. From my observation of women around me, I noticed that many mothers want to spend more time with their children and read them bed time stories, but don’t have the time to do so. Therefore, I created a podcast to read children’s books. I want to relieve the guilt of the busy mothers for not spending enough time with their kids.

Now with the help of EIIG, I want to help women small business owners with generating incomes and eventually making a better life.

All those impacts I have made were truly enriching. However, my main takeaway is that solely volunteering cannot resolve the fundamental problem for underrepresented groups. Since people cannot rely on volunteers forever, there is a need for under resourced groups to be financially independent which is what EIIG provides to micro-businesses through their loaning program. During the coffee chat and info sessions, I realized that EIIG is an organization seeking to serve entrepreneurs in need and aligns perfectly with my desire to serve the greater Atlanta community. As a student looking for a way to make a communal impact, I appreciated how EIIG directly benefitted entrepreneurs through projects specifically tailored to their business. Moreover, talking to different analysts helped me learn how thorough the entrepreneur screening process is. I realized how EIIG values each entrepreneur’s commitment to social impact and community service, not just solely limiting the loan process to assessing the business’ financials. For example, EIIG’s method of not assessing credit scores when evaluating loan applicants demonstrates their awareness of how an entrepreneur’s passion and ideas can supersede their financial history. Ultimately, the mission of EIIG helping micro-businesses who are passionate in serving their community resonates to my past works and values.","In 9th grade, I went to Laos for a service trip. During our last day, the villagers of Ban Houayon prepared a Baci ceremony, which is blessing safety on our way back home. As about ten women trotted down and started to dance, the deliberate movements of their wrists and ankles lingered in my mind long after I had left the village. There was a whole history behind their movements, and I wanted to learn more. This initial experience with a foreign dance and culture spurred my interest in ethnochoreology and its role in sociocultural anthropology. 
When I was a senior in high school, I had an opportunity to collaborate with a West African choreographer. He taught me the Mandinka dance, which is accompanied by Kassa music. I found the basic steps and isolation moves like today’s wildly popular K-POP dances, which made me curious about how dance styles flowed from one culture to another and evolved over time. I decided to delve deeper and explore the concepts of how African dance evolved throughout history and influenced the dances of various countries into the modern day, taking a closer look at the influence and evolution of African Diaspora dance from an anthropological perspective. 
Like the influence African dance gave to other cultures, African-inspired dance is universally popular, but it is not well understood. By analyzing not only African culture but also other underrepresented voices everywhere, I will continue to spread the importance and influence those cultures have in our society.","As part of the community branch of Amnesty PLUS, I managed the promotion of various human rights campaigns through Instagram. Finding a way to effectively communicate through a single post was as rewarding as it was challenging. At first, what I only needed was my achievement through the project. However, the first campaign proved that wrong. As random people also joined the campaign, my perception shifted to an acknowledgement of a wider community. Then, I organized team meetings more frequently to discuss together about the project. I also reached out to different group of people to research about what they value and applied their voices to our campaigns. I learned that I should put myself in other’s shoes when it comes to dealing with a broader community and collaborating with a huge team. My consciousness of the community is what I want to continue as an EIIG analyst.","The community that has shaped my integral identity was LOA, Lights On Again. LOA is a dance team which I was involved in for all 4 years of my high school life. As a passionate dancer, I was ready to dedicate my talents towards dance. However, as a student who valued academic performances as well, I had to balance well between my academics and socials. The main reason I committed so much time to LOA was because of the sense of belonging within the community that was fulfilling. In the weekdays, we helped each other with assignments in our spare time at the dance room. In the weekends, we danced altogether and sometimes went to the beach to relax outside from school. As clubs exist to not only gain technical experiences, but also to get along with each other, LOA was a great reflection of me and my values.",,4.4375,0.677,0.897,

Although many business organizations exist at Emory, EIIG stands out to me in its focus on collaboration for the greater good. From my past volunteer and leadership experience, I’ve learned that nothing is more rewarding than to see tangible improvements to your community from your work. Past work from EIIG at Emory has helped local entrepreneurs bridge the “micro-business” gap, facilitating the growth of high-impact small businesses in areas that traditionally lack them. Joining EIIG would provide me with a way to give back to our Atlanta community.

The skills emphasized in EIIG’s consulting work makes the organization a good fit for me as well. As a QSS and BBA dual-degree student, currently, I’m enthusiastic about the ways data analysis and upgrades to digital systems can be used to optimize the operations of a business. Team Kevin’s work last semester focused on this digitization process, using analysis of the Amazon store SEO to attract more interest and customers to his business. My experience with Python, R, and passion for statistical methods, make my skill set well suited for 180’s projects.

Lastly, I have heard nothing but praise throughout my first semester at Emory about the community of EIIG. EIIG’s collaborative atmosphere would allow me to reach my potential as a learner. ","I didn’t speak my first word of English until my first day of elementary school. Despite being born in the United States, my parents had only ever spoken to me in Mandarin growing up. With my father constantly bouncing from job to job, it left no time or money to ever afford for my brother and I to be sent to daycare. As a result, I grew up believing only the television and our landlady spoke English. I didn’t get comfortable with the language until I reached first grade.

As I entered high school, I made it my goal to make the education process easier on the next generation of children of immigrants, so that those who struggle with English would not have to struggle through education as well. Through tutoring students in math with the Triunfadores College Prep Program, a program designed for economically disadvantaged ESL students, I found a way to accomplish my goal.

I’ve tutored students from countries as far away as Chile to places as close as Puerto Rico. And yet, I still find a way to relate to each one of my students, helping them to feel comfortable enough around me to allow their curiosity to flourish. All of my past students ended up passing their End of Year exams with flying colors. Some students have even offered to teach me Spanish for my lessons! I happily oblige.

No matter where my career may take me, I’m confident that my desire to mentor will follow close behind.","In high school, I served as the Vice President of my school’s competition math team. Part of my responsibilities in the job was to recruit freshmen to join the divisions that historically had lacked members in the team. In past years, turnout amongst freshmen at interest meetings for the team had been low. 

Ultimately, I came up with the idea that is still used by the team today: using an extra credit system. Students who regularly participated in practices and competitions, regardless of performance, would be eligible to receive bonus points for math classes. Furthermore, focus was put on improvement, rather than placing high in competitions, when developing lesson plans for the teams. By doing so, it led to students who did not normally enjoy math to participate, as a way to improve their problem solving skills in general. The judgment-free environment advertised significantly improved member turnout in the club.","I’ve always enjoyed playing with numbers. Whether it was betting over college football games, or analyzing voting patterns in past election cycles, I’ve always been able to lose myself in the world of chance and probability. Throughout high school, I felt unfulfilled by the standard math courses offered by the school. Therefore, my passion for problem solving eventually led me to the competition math team, which I eventually began competing for. It was through this competitive environment that I was first introduced to the competitive math world, which I quickly fell in love with.

The camaraderie while preparing for competitions, the team meals after discussing answers and trading jokes: these were things I remember from my time with the team, not test questions or score results. As I look back at my high school experience, I’m most proud of the bonds I formed as a part of the team.",,4.375,0.67,0.916,

EIIG’s process of working with one-person run businesses and staying with them for three years throughout the entire implementation process resonates with me.

Although I initially went as a part of a trip with my robotics group, I ended up continuing to go every semester after through my school’s volunteer program. On my first visit, we helped small groups of kids build miniature robots and play with them. When I came back again, the kids recognized me and were happy to see me. At that moment I felt I had made a connection with the community. After our few robotics trips ended, I signed up to go weekly as a tutor. At the time I was also learning Spanish and had met a handful of kids that refused to speak to any volunteers in English. These kids were referred to by other volunteers as the “troublemakers”. I tried to communicate in Spanish and to my surprise the kids were very receptive and opened up to me. Despite my Spanish not being perfect at the time, I realized by making an effort to show appreciation for an integral part of their upbringing, I was able to become more approachable and relevant in their lives. Volunteering became important to me as I saw I could make real positive change. I participated in ACLAMO for the rest of my time in high school and was passionate about learning more about each child and helping them through school.","At the start of my second year in high school, I found myself struggling in AP World History. I was intimidated by the long readings and endless pages of notes. I contemplated dropping the class. I was constantly looking for shortcuts and finding ways around the work. I eventually realized this was not a solution. Luckily, I discovered an online study community and the use of calligraphy in notes. I found a way to look forward to nightly readings by introducing an artistic element to the process. I taught myself how to use calligraphy to make headers and structure my notes in an aesthetically pleasing way. I started looking forward to my calligraphy sessions and summarizing what I had learned each class. By opening myself up to a different way of addressing the problem, I was able to find a new source of motivation and enjoy doing my work.","Throughout my entire life, I lived in an area lacking diversity of thought. I had never been exposed to different perspectives until the summer after my first year of high school. I started working at my first job in a nail salon. I was surrounded by people from completely different backgrounds. Most of my co-workers were 5-10 years older than me and came from countries like Cambodia and Vietnam. I initially was scared and unsure if I would fit in or develop close friendships. After two weeks, I found that salon was where I felt the most comfortable. The women were adults facing true life struggles. They showed me a different view of the world and instilled in me core values of work ethic and resilience. I thought our differences would not let us connect, however, they are what allowed for me to see the world in a different way.",,4.270833333333334,0.644,0.763,

I really liked learning about how involved the analyst and research positions are at EIIG, and I’m open to trying any available roles. Being an analyst on the due diligence or consulting part of the process seems very intriguing, and I would love to dive headfirst into assessing the finances of companies and working with real world data. Additionally, I would be interested in working closely with entrepreneurs in the consulting stage. Collaborating with others to ensure that they get the proper care and resources needed to succeed would be very rewarding, and I would love to be a part of the EIIG team by aiding in this part of the process. The research and collaboration skills that EIIG teaches would be very helpful, regardless of what team I’m on, and are important for any job later in life. I believe these skills are ones that would develop me into a more well-rounded student and person, and I’m eager for the chance to gain this experience. From what I’ve seen, EIIG is a down to earth organization making a real difference by supporting grassroots entrepreneurs, and I would love to contribute to EIIG’s continued success.","My Eagle Scout project is something that I am extremely passionate about. For my project I fundraised, planned, and rounded up volunteers to help create two movable, raised garden beds for people with disabilities at a rehabilitation facility. My mom works for the Shirley Ryan Ability Lab in the suburbs of Chicago, and she brought to my attention that they were moving facilities and wouldn’t have any green space to garden at the new one. I was looking for Eagle Scout project ideas at the time, and I thought it would be valuable to enable to patients to partake in this therapeutic activity that they would really enjoy. Since my mom works at this rehabilitation facility, I’ve seen and heard about the struggles that some of these patients go through. Rehabilitation isn’t easy, and if I could make patients’ days just a little bit better by allowing them to garden, then that’s what I was going to do. I fundraised, drew up blueprints, and crafted instructions for the creation of the garden beds. The assembly and transportation of the garden beds took around 6 hours with the help of approximately 30 kid and 10 adult volunteers. With the installation of these garden beds, patients at the new facility can now garden at their leisure, and they still stand today over 4 years later. Overall, this project was important to me because it allowed me to make a real difference in my local community for patients who needed help.","During my most recent summer job at a catering company, I was tasked with checking a catalog of foods items, with a list of discontinued products to make sure we were not offering clients any products that we weren’t making any more. I wasn’t that well versed in excel at the time and the list was way too long to check by hand, so I had to think outside the box for alternative solutions. To remedy this issue, I decided to make a program to do the work for me, so I used a free online compiler and got to work. Using my java knowledge obtained from my past AP Computer Science class, I created a program that cross checked the lists for me and saved myself a couple hours’ worth of work. ","My Church community is one that has influenced my identity and actions. I love the community here at Emory that has enriched my faith, and my original parish and community back home provided me with moral values to uphold and mentors to look up to. I have found fellowship here at Emory through the Emory catholic center, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and Bread Coffeehouse. Being a Catholic is part of who I am, and I try to act in a way that reflects the values I learned from my faith. One central idea that I learned from my faith is helping others before you help yourself. EIIG lifting up small business owners is a perfect example of putting others before yourself, and I’m excited of the possibility of being part of a group that promotes such values.

It works to better the community while also providing members with the opportunity to connect with other like-minded students. To build professional experience and connections through EIIG’s model is an unique opportunity, and it would have a profound impact on my professional, academic, and personal lives. Through EIIG I plan to meet not only new business connections but also true friends with similar interests. I plan to further my academic knowledge and contribute positively to the Atlanta community through consulting. I believe EIIG would provide an opportunity to use business knowledge to better the world, and that is, to me, the most important skill I could ever learn. Work should be not just a job, but also fulfilling spiritually if possible, and finding the intersection between investing and doing genuine good in the community absolutely fills that criterion. Small businesses are the backbone of a thriving local community not controlled by corporations and political forces, and I would love the opportunity to work with EIIG to achieve this in Atlanta. ","A project I was involved in that I am most passionate about was the Louisville Youth Philanthropy Council (LYPC). LYPC was a program through which two teams of high school students created a mission statement and then researched and interviewed local nonprofits to find one to invest $10,000 into in order to maximize positive social impact on our community. We were also responsible for raising those funds for the investments. Through the opportunity to invest in promising local nonprofits, I was able to impact my community positively: one year my team provided housing for single mothers and their children, for example, and another we funded dozens of people entering drug abuse and housing programs in Louisville. It was important to me because it allowed me to get hands-on involvement with nonprofit work, which is something I am very passionate about. Seeing those tangible impacts of real people being helped by my dedication and passion was incredibly meaningful and motivating to me. I made many great friends and connected with other civic activists in my city, and we all worked together to make the world a better place. There is little I can think of that is more important than that.","During high school, I took a programming class at a college summer camp in which I had to design and build a robot with a partner. My partner and I quickly discovered our robot was slightly inaccurate to its turning measurements, making it miss key points by crucial inches. For a while my partner and I, and the instructor, could not fix this faulty mechanic. Eventually, I realized that fixing the robot wasn't the goal; we simply had to make the robot turn the correct amount. By testing angles, I discovered patterns to how much extra it would turn given different measurements. I noted each excess angle, factoring it into each turn. This solved our problem, and our robot tied for first in the class competition. Creativity, I believe, is not abstract; it is the art of questioning assumptions until none remain, opening all possible avenues for analytical problem solving.","One community that shaped my identity is Kentucky’s mock government and UN conventions, called KYA and KUNA. These conventions connected me to some incredible, fascinating individuals over the years. An important lesson I learned at these conventions is that being cool is not cool. For most of high school, I valued popularity and ‘coolness’ too much. However, the most admirable, happy people I’ve ever met were at these conventions, and they were all shameless, authentic, and unapologetically weird. That mentality also makes them kind, positive people. Following their example has allowed me to become my own person, unimpeded by social pressure. Many of these peers have become lifelong friends, and I owe a great deal of my happiness to their example. I can tell, when I reflect, that I am a friendlier, happier, and more driven person because of the community I had at KYA and KUNA.",,4.1875,0.634,0.776,

I have always been drawn to organizations that work to improve the lives of individuals and communities, and I believe that EIIG is one such organization. The club’s focus on community engagement and social impact aligns with my personal values and passions, so I am excited to work with and learn from a diverse group of individuals who share these values. 

Last semester, I worked on a team that consulted for a non profit which helped people with food insecurity effectively locate food pantries throughout the US. Working on this project not only felt rewarding, but also taught me a lot about conducting market research and presenting my recommendations in a digestible manner. However, our team did not work with the client long enough to see the potential implementation of our recommendations which is an aspect of consulting I find disappointing. After hearing about the deep relationships formed between EIIG analysts and their clients that span over multiple semesters, I knew that this was an organization I wanted to be a part of. Growing professionally alongside clients, I look forward to not only seeing the potential implementation of certain recommendations, but also the business’ growth and the impact it creates on its surrounding community. ","As president of my high school chess club, I effectively managed a team of five officers to host a local tournament for local middle and elementary schoolers. What started out as just a fun idea quickly developed into a real plan after my team produced a written proposal. After identifying all the actionable steps that needed to be taken and facilitating a dialogue designed to empower them to have agency in the decision-making process, I delegated tasks to different officers based on their strengths and areas for growth. To illustrate, one of my friends specialized in creating clean logos so he was responsible for creating the poster while I, with my connections to school staff, focused on advertising to local schools. I started by advertising the event through posting flyers around the targeted schools. However, this method did not attract a lot of sign ups which I addressed by focusing on digital marketing through school sponsored emails. On the day of the event, around 40 kids showed up to play in our tournament and my team ran a successful event. At the end of the tournament, this event felt like one of the most rewarding moments of my life because my team and I had given so many kids the same opportunity that we had to grow and learn more about life through chess. ","At the Oxford campus, a common issue students face is overpaying for food delivery services such as Doordash due to a lack of on campus late night meal options. For example, a standard Chipotle burrito which usually costs around $10 can cost students nearly double the price with hidden service fees when . Recognizing this problem, my friend and I decided to address this issue by launching a business that provided students with warm meals from Waffle House at a cheaper price than Uber and Doordash. Our business worked by consolidating user orders on a Google spreadsheet up to a certain time like 10pm. At 10pm, our orders would close and we would make the trip to the waffle house in order to pick up all of the orders and deliver them back to students on campus. Through this model, we received 20 orders in our first couple days of operation. ","It's impossible to curate an image of what a chess player looks like because of the sheer diversity of the chess community. This is what I noticed at my first tournament in the San Diego Chess Club. Every Saturday morning for four years, I went to the San Diego Chess Club for their weekly Gambito tournaments. Through my time spent here, I improved my opening, middle, and endgame strategy while also building meaningful friendships with people from all walks of life. For example, I became close friends with International Master and renowned author, Cyrus Lakdawala, who eventually became my coach. As a strict Buddhist, he often incorporated life lessons into our sessions which helped me grow as a person and chess player. While playing blitz matches with various opponents, I gained an appreciation for different perspectives, and in turn, this transformed me into a more open-minded individual. ",,4.0625,0.604,0.597,

I resonate with EIIG’s goal of providing resources to these entrepreneurs and business-owners because it closely mirrors my past projects. For example, I worked with an organization that helped struggling brick-and-mortar businesses transition onto digital platforms during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which heavily impacted many small local businesses in my hometown. Experiences like these developed my passion for supporting disadvantaged communities, and most importantly for value-driven work that creates lasting impact. This is what draws me to EIIG: an organization that has the technical skills and knowledge to be able to provide the financing and consulting services necessary to sustain business growth, but also deeply values relationship-based advising to best assist their clients on a more personal level. I’m eager to join EIIG to gain real-world, hands-on learning experience through a variety of projects - specifically, I’m eager to learn more about strategic cost analysis, competitor analysis, and human capital management. By fostering ideas in EIIG’s collaborative environment with members that learn from each other, and in a community where members genuinely want to drive change through their work, I know the insights and experiences I will gain will be invaluable. ","To find me, look for the girl reciting her speech by talking to the wall. My hands gesture with every word; my eyes dart animatedly, as if engaging an imaginary audience. To find me, look for the girl standing in a black blazer and red heels, delivering her speech passionately to a panel of final-round judges. The hours of practice make my performance easy, and I deliver each line and movement with both purpose and flair - ensuring that my personality shines alongside my messages. 

When I first started speech and debate in high school, I hesitated to share my own opinions, fearing others would disagree or dismiss my ideas. I forced myself to “go with the flow”, not knowing if or how I could create an impact. However, years of competing has taught me the importance of using my voice to pursue advocacy and equality through speech and debate. Today, I communicate my concerns about foreign operations affecting my family overseas, and educational poverty gripping local children. I grapple with consequential political, economic, and humanitarian issues, and strive for my audiences to recognize the real implications behind each topic. 

More than a win-loss ratio, this activity represents my commitment towards becoming a more conscientious and open-minded citizen. Speech and debate gives me the ability to move away from walls, and onto larger platforms.
","I sit, shoulders hunched, surveying the sketch in front of me. Fingers covered in charcoal, I brush away a loose strand of hair, probably leaving a smudge. With only my thoughts keeping me company, my pencil darts over the page smoothly. The seemingly random sketched lines and messy shapes form into the impressions of a figure, transforming into life on the page, and bringing me inexplicable joy.

Creation is a state where I am efficient, practiced, thorough, and immersed. Artistic expression is what helps me think through my most difficult problems, as it provides me with both clarity and calm. Whether it’s sketching out diagrams or drawing out different scenarios, creative brainstorming through art is what helps me best evaluate, analyze, and dissect. Ironically, I am most rational and organized after I’ve just spilled all my thoughts out onto the page - art is my go-to problem solver.
","I’ve lived in Toronto, Indianapolis, Seattle, the Bay Area, and two different provinces in China. I’ve met people with different cultural backgrounds, familial values, political ideologies, and world views. If there’s anything I am certain of, it’s that no single label can define a sentient being’s complexity. But as much as I know that this is true, I’ve struggled for my whole life over trying to nail down my identity. And as an Asian American from a multicultural background, this was made even more complex. Growing up in Indiana, I never felt like I was fully Chinese, or fully American. When I went to China, my relatives mocked me for not knowing Chinese slang, or for not knowing all the important cultural holidays and traditions.

In middle school, I joined a Chinese cultural dance team. Each practice served as a reminder of my background - an opportunity to bring a piece of my culture’s traditions and historical art forms to the suburbs of greater Seattle. Even though I no longer dance, this experience taught me to be proud of my background, culture, and traditions, and to embrace them to represent my community.

In this role, I was responsible for leading a team of students that functioned as writers and photographers in creating a newspaper that covered a wide range of topics, including local and national news, feature stories, and opinion pieces. The newspaper served as a platform for community engagement and connection, providing a voice for students. 

One of the most rewarding aspects of this role was the opportunity to work with a diverse group of students with different interests and backgrounds. Their different perspectives taught me the value of teamwork and how to utilize the strengths of each individual. 

As editor, I was able to connect with my community in deeper ways than I thought possible. My team and I covered important topics such as student mental health resources, local politics, and school safety. The newspaper fostered dialogue between students about important issues. My time at the newspaper taught me the power of media in fostering informed dialogue and the power of effective teamwork in accomplishing shared goals. I am grateful for the work my team produced and the community I interacted with.","As an intern at a law firm, I had the opportunity to use my creativity to solve a variety of problems. The most significant projects I worked on were the relocation of the office and improving the firm’s IT infrastructure. 

This involved digitizing the individual documents of each client file and assigning them a corresponding physical location. Creating a digital inventory of all the documents made the process more efficient and ensured the documents would be safe even if something happened to them during the move.

In addition to managing the office relocation, I also streamlined the law firms’ internal IT infrastructure. The outdated methods were wasting the valuable time of the attorneys, so I came up with solutions that improved the efficiency of the business operations. 

Overall, my creative solutions helped ensure the successful office relocation and the security of the client documents, while also streamlining internal business processes.","One community that has shaped a part of my identity is the Spanish immersion elementary school I attended.

Being part of this community helped me develop a strong sense of empathy towards people of different backgrounds. It shaped my love for language and new cultural experiences.

In my senior year of high school, I gained exposure to the operations and initiatives of an environmentally-conscious company through an internship at TOP Organics—an ethical, organic feminine product company. My work at TOP spawned my commitment to continuing the mission of working to transform harmful everyday-use products into environmentally friendly alternatives. I participated in sustainability-related activities throughout my high school career. I was a part of the Environmental Club, where we discussed ways to improve the environment and changes we could make to decrease land and sea pollution.
Additionally, I participated in a Brown University program where I was challenged to create/design a product/service to assist in improving social change. I concentrated on environmentally harmful plastic six-pack bottle holders. I developed a product that was pitched to a panel of Brown staff and students. Through this program, I realized my true passion for saving our environment. This endeavor opened my eyes to the amount of plastic pollution produced and the various negative ways pollution contributes to climate change. My program experience impacted how I view business initiatives. I now understand the driving factor of possessing a passion for the goal being sought after. Impact-oriented initiatives proving beneficial to my community motivate and inspire me to work toward success. ","Upon joining an organization at the beginning of my Freshman year at Emory, I realized my desire to develop a bond with these individuals whom I would be spending time with for the remainder of my college career. Although each member of the organization was acquainted, we had never set aside time to speak one-on-one or extensively familiarize ourselves.
	In an effort to enhance our relationships with one another, I proposed the idea of engaging in a “locked room event.” This event required these members to avoid technology and engage in meaningful conversation with one another. Every individual could experience the opportunity to connect in ways they had not previously expected. Instead of developing surface-level relationships, I felt that this approach permitted the development of genuine connections. Each member expressed gratitude for this event as it served as the starting point for the formation of authentic friendships.","I have grown up as a Catholic, immersed in my mother’s religious heritage and traditions. Yet, my father is Jewish, and it was not until after I attended a family Bar Mitzvah that I realized how little understanding I had of Judaism. This unfamiliarity with Judaism made me realize how disconnected I was from my Jewish side. 
I sought out my father and expressed my desire to familiarize myself with Judaism. Due to my family’s involvement in my Catholic schooling, my father had also grown distant from his Jewish faith.  
I used to believe that I could not practice Judaism if I practiced Catholicism. However, I realize both religions lead me to make thoughtful decisions and live a values-driven life. I now embody the similarities between the faiths and carry their influence in my life. Both religions definitively shape who I am and how I operate in this world.",,4.25,0.644,0.8,

I have always been focused on giving back to communities around me. Specifically in EIIG, I hope to apply the knowledge I’ve learned from Goizueta to help close the micro-business gap that is extremely prominent in the Atlanta community. Despite not receiving a position in the fall, my hopes of becoming a member of EIIG have never diminished. 

Recently, I dove into the EIIG impact reports from the past years. I paid specific attention to the deployment breakdown of the various companies and fund allocations. I was impressed by the $15,000 loan given to Mary-Ellen Sheehan that helped expand her skincare company. While learning more about EIIG, I discovered something special; not only is EIIG helping small businesses around us, these small businesses are further making an impact on other communities such as focusing on celebrating African American children and cafes that promote healthy living.

I would be thrilled to either focus on due diligence, conducting in-depth analysis of credit and risk, or focus on consulting where I would have the opportunity to help optimize the growth of the businesses. I also hope to study consulting and finance once I enter the business school, and I believe this would be extremely beneficial to my role in EIIG. I would truly be honored to join this amazing group that has already made such a large impact on members of the community around us. As a member, I would hope to provide the right help to further strengthen our impact on closing the micro-business gap and create even greater sustainable growth for small businesses. ","During my time at Emory, I have discovered that there is much more to the business world than just numbers and spreadsheets; there’s also so much space for community involvement. I’ve found a passion in utilizing the business world and its resources to make an impact on communities around me.

As a community involvement associate in GIMG, I was able to work on a project this semester that I was extremely passionate about; I created a financial literacy curriculum revolving around four key educational capabilities: career opportunities in business, the value of investments, a brief history of economics, and an overview of the college application process. I will be teaching the curriculum to high school students in Maynard Jackson High and Druid Hills High. It is my hope that this financial literacy curriculum can help expand students perspectives and possibly introduce to them aspects of the business world that are often not discussed in schools. My team also decided to create a curriculum on the college application process. As Emory students on the opposite side of the process, our perspectives and tips on the college process could possibly be beneficial to some students that may not have access to many college application resources; if the lesson impacts even one student, I consider this project a success. 

This project was extremely important to me because despite being a part of business clubs in high school, I was never able to actually use my skills and knowledge in business and apply it to support a greater cause. It is my hope that this financial literacy curriculum can help support the greater Atlanta community by expanding students’ perspectives and introducing to them different aspects of the world of business. At EIIG, I hope to further make an impact on the community around me. ","Through expressing myself creatively, I learned that sometimes less is truly more. For two Summers in high school, I worked as an associate and lead teacher at a STEM Summer camp. This camp sold products called Genius Gem Tiles, which were magnetic tiles that children could build with. One day, the CEO of the company was discussing with me how sales weren’t increasing despite increased marketing and campers. At first I was stumped. Our team had worked greatly on updating our marketing plan and promoting the tiles. It was then that I remembered a conversation that I had with a customer. He was asking me which tiles I would recommend he get for his son’s birthday. He seemed overwhelmed with the options, specifically the different designs and colors that were only slightly different in each set. He ultimately left without buying anything. After reflecting on this conversation, I thought about the importance of adding restraints. This halt in profit could be due to customers feeling overwhelmed by the various options. My boss and I decided then to implement boundaries in the website by limiting some of the options. After just a few weeks my boss reported that sales had increased and ever since then, the company has focused on adding restraints to the amount of products available. ","While growing up, I’ve always been extremely involved in my community, specifically the special needs community. My cousin has Down Syndrome, and it was difficult for my aunt and uncle-in-law who both worked long hours to take care of her. As a result, my mom and I would often pick her up and watch a movie or go grab some ice cream. Ever since a young age, these experiences have greatly shaped who I am and more specifically my personality and values. Throughout middle school and high school, I became greatly involved in different organizations that supported children with disabilities. In high school, I worked with the special olympics, volunteered as a teacher’s assistant at non-profit schools and camps for children with Autism, and was the VP of my school’s Unified Club that supported children with disabilities in my town. Not only did these experiences instill in me a passion for volunteering with children with special needs, it also instilled in me a passion for giving back to various communities whether that be working on period poverty or becoming a mentor at Emory SPARK.

During middle school I was able to serve on a district council to help better the schools in my community, in high school I worked intently with an organization to increase mental health resources for young adults all around NYC. I loved being involved with my community, even if my community was a city of eight million people. I have only been at Emory for a semester, but I want to get involved within the city of Atlanta. The thought of being able to help people in the Atlanta area through impact investing really excites me. Sitting in the interest meeting and seeing how EIIG and its members invest in small businesses and help them throughout their journey fascinated me. It is easy to just throw money at a small business and hope it grows, but the fact that EIIG forms a relationship with that business owner and consults them for years is what sets EIIG apart from other business clubs here at Emory. I have always been enthralled with the idea of investing and small business; Having the opportunity to combine community involvement with my love for investing is what drives me to join EIIG.","When I was in high school I was a member of a non-profit organization called the Citizens Committee for Children (CCC). This organization was committed to making sure every child in NYC was educated, safe, and housed. I started my work with the CCC in freshman year and from the first meeting I was hooked. Our first project was addressing the youth mental health crisis in NYC. We analyzed the entire budget of NYC for months and drafted proposals that would allocate more money to mental health resources in schools for teens. We drafted and launched a NYC Youth survey that garnered over 2,000 responses to analyze what parts of the city needed the most resources. We travelled up to the state capitol in Albany as a group and met with over ten legislatures to talk about mental health and the budget. I had created a strong bond with my other peers while working towards our goal of more mental health resources, we had all become so vulnerable with one another and I think that really showed not only us but our lawmakers that there is a mental health crisis that needed to be addressed.  This initiative was so important to me. Before doing this, I was afraid to speak at small meetings, nevertheless in a conference room filled with lawmakers. I learned how to collaborate effectively and efficiently. In the process of giving a voice to underserved youth in NYC, I was able to find my own.
","My entire junior year of high school was remote, and it was also my first year as Editor-in-Chief of our school newspaper. I remember the club facilitator telling us the newspaper may have to be put on pause due to a lack of interest. That was the moment I knew that I had to think creatively. I thought, how could I draw interest in joining an online only newspaper during remote school? The editors and I brainstormed for hours on how to draw interest and we curated humorous social media posts that would draw people to the club. I came up with an agenda for our first club meeting of the year and it included games, riddles, and funny Q&A’s, in order to keep students on zoom for an extra hour a day it had to be fun. That year we ended up producing the most editions in school history.

","A community that has shaped part of my identity is my family. I come from a family of five but an extended family with over 25 first cousins, aunts and uncles. Every summer we go on a trip to South Carolina that has been spear headed by my grandad for over thirty years. I remember in the summer of 2021 my grandad was sick and his doctors told him not to go on the trip, but he ended up coming anyways. Every morning of that trip I got up with him at 8 AM and I got him dressed, prepared breakfast and talked about his childhood together. Those seven mornings were the best of my life, the only thirty minutes of quiet in a house of 25 people. Those mornings shaped me, they taught me loyalty, respect and the importance of taking care of those who took care of you. ",,3.95,0.585,0.548,

From discussions with EIIG analysts, I learned that they not only provide valuable services to local small businesses, but also care about clients on a personal level. As someone with a history of working for small businesses, I know how difficult starting a business can be. In 2021, I worked for my dad’s small business that employs caregivers to take care of the elderly. During my time there, I was able to help them with client outreach, hiring and communicating with caregivers, and regulatory paperwork. I was energized by supporting NYC elderly while helping the business grow. I witnessed my dad prioritize the support and mental health of caregivers and clients over revenue, which connects to my own desire to give back to my community. EIIG’s mission to support socially impactful businesses aligns with my values that businesses can have maximum success when they positively impact their community, and I am committed to achieve that.

Beyond the work EIIG does, the community seems incredibly warm and supportive. Being around people who contribute to my own personal growth and who I can contribute to as well is important to me. Some skills I hope to share with other members and entrepreneurs are problem solving, strong communication, and organization. I’m also eager to learn more about financial analysis from the due diligence division, as well as consulting. Above all, I’m eager to pursue opportunities where my work has an impact on my community.","I’m passionate about social justice, which is seen through my current job working for an Atlanta based non-profit theater company called Out Of Hand Theatre. This company focuses on producing works of art that educate the public on social justice issues. Each production is hand-picked to support their goal of performing pieces regarding racial, wealth, gender, and other disparities in the Atlanta community. After each production, Out Of Hand facilitates a conversation over dinner about the topics discussed in the play. This part is arguably the most important because it lets audience members actively grasp the material and explore topics normally not discussed at the dinner table. When the production starts, I’m looking forward to attending these dinners to learn other people’s perspectives. I’m currently working on organizing the Shows in Homes series, in which award-winning actor Ingrid Griffith will perform her show Shirley Chisholm: Unbossed and Unbowed, about the first African American woman to run for presidency, in strangers’ homes. I’m excited to be working on the logistics of adapting a script, creating contracts, welcoming Ingrid to Atlanta, and more. Many people probably haven’t heard of Shirley Chisholm, even though they probably should have. My goal is to spread the word so that future generations are more comfortable talking about social justice problems in public.","Throughout my life, I’ve been very involved in production and design roles in theater communities. In high school, I enrolled in a theater class where students independently wrote, designed, and produced a full-length play. During my senior year, my school wouldn’t let us put on our play in person due to Covid-19. Instead of giving up, we adapted to a hybrid format. Utilizing Premiere Pro, we filmed and edited masked actors, not letting restrictions stop us from creating our work. As the Production Stage Manager, I had to do a lot of problem solving, as I was used to live productions, not taped ones. I researched video editing techniques and learned ways to track footage. At first I thought recording our show would be an issue, but I grew to appreciate the opportunity to create an original piece of art, while growing my own skills. ","	Judaism and Emory Hillel have shaped my identity. Growing up in NYC, I lived walking distance to my synagogue and attended services for high holidays. Judaism has always been an integral part of my upbringing, as I cherish family traditions and how the holidays bring us together. Before coming to Emory, I was worried I wouldn’t have the opportunity to connect with my Jewish heritage. This was until I got to campus and realized how welcoming Hillel is. No matter if I go for Shabbat dinner every Friday or only a few times a semester, the Rabbi and other students there always make it a fun and inclusive night. At Hillel I’m able to remember how being Jewish has connected me to so many people and provides me with a stable and open community. I continue to enjoy how the songs and prayers provide an opportunity to escape and reflect.",,3.958333333333333,0.582,0.495,

Being a part of Schmaltz Deli, a family-owned local Jewish deli, had shown me a new perspective that emphasized community and overcoming hardship as a new form of fulfillment. Working overtime hours, covering for other peoples’ shifts, and trying to build a base of dependent customers, had instilled a lifelong initiative of wanting to continue my mission of working with small businesses.  

Acclimating myself as a first-year in a new environment and making an impact in a community like Atlanta is extremely important to what I want to accomplish at Emory; with prior experiences in building a music production program that teaches underprivileged kids in my area and organizing book drives within a tutoring organization, I now know the actions that are necessary to positively impact my peers and community around me. The fulfillment that follows helping a group of people, in some shape or form, is something that is unique, but also imperative to the way I want to pursue my business major. With my pursuit in BBA and QSS, I want to change the way my peers think by highlighting the importance of uplifting disadvantaged and smaller local entrepreneurs. By using data and technology to build financial growth models and other measurables, I want to facilitate improvements to the businesses that are integral to the Atlanta community, which is something I can continue to explore at EIIG. ","During the start of the pandemic, I had the opportunity to develop an instructive music production program, which eventually came to fruition at the start of my Senior year. As I was implementing this program as a part of the Alive Center, a nonprofit focused on providing creative spaces to kids in my area, I continuously had doubts about whether I had the credibility or status to be teaching something quite complex to kids. However, as I went through the development process of the program with fantastic mentors, I realized that this process would allow me to learn a lot about myself as well. 

As the program finally kicked off, I vividly remember ten kids, crammed into the studio room playing around with the MIDI drum set, and blasting piano chords on the keyboard. Although these Friday afternoons were extremely chaotic, they ended up being my favorite part of the week. Watching a kid’s creative instincts be uplifted and transformed into a substance that they can go back and listen to, was something that fulfilled my desire to give back. Throughout my entire life, I have been surrounded by older students, creative and academic programs, guidance, and support which helped blossom me into who I am today; the idea that I reciprocated these resources back to kids who may have not been surrounded by guidance and support was extremely heartwarming and helped me discover a passion for uplifting others’ interests into reality. ","During a senior trip in Montague, Michigan last year, my friends and I encountered the arduous problem of cutting watermelon. Cutting watermelons is by no means difficult, however, with a two-day timeline and the absence of knives, ingenious engineering was required.  

I suggested setting up a workshop outside on a tree stump, where we created sticky tack by rolling up the array of glue sticks found in the Airbnb’s basement. The sticky tack that we stuck onto the watermelon provided stability for the watermelons to be cut with ease, using the saw we found in the shed. We proceeded to flesh out the watermelon with floss, and our complex situation was finally resolved. The combination of spontaneity, stupidity, and resourcefulness was unique to our group; I now know that finding solutions is easier when with a group just as ambitious and creative as you are. ","Last semester, I had formed a midnight therapy session, where me and a group of friends spontaneously ran out to grab food at Woody's following a long day at the library. We bonded over QTM 110, until our conversations started to transform into anything we could possibly talk about: Thai Coconut Curry at DCT, messy relationships, and the new SZA album were all trending hot topics that provided a sense of community away from my monotonous, rigorous academic life. 

The idiocy and spontaneity of the group was something that seemed so insignificant, but also important to the way I wanted to live. I realized how important it was to bring balance to my life; being instinctive amidst a routine of hardships are the memories that I will recollect the most and is something I hope to continue at EIIG.

Compared with other organizations at Emory, the level of engagement and interaction between EIIG and these small businesses impresses me the most as I learned that the consulting service will last throughout the repayment period. I look forward to learning about these small business owners from the development and due diligence phases and seeing their businesses grow when the consulting services I offered get implemented. 

On top of that, I feel passionate about the types of clients EIIG typically works with. I see an embroidery company that supports small businesses impacted by protests, and a mobile car detailing business committed to ESG. I will feel extremely fulfilled if my commitment can help these socially impactful businesses to continue their meaningful mission. 

Despite what EIIG does, I want to join EIIG because of its culture and the people inside the organization. I enjoy EIIG's commitment to celebrating different cultures by hosting events that cherish individual nationalities. I enjoy all the thoughtful advice I received from the coffee and bagel chat. I was also amazed by the detailed feedback I received last year after the case interview. I look forward to developing generous friendships with other members as we all share a common passion for making small businesses in Atlanta thrive.","A project that I was involved in that I am passionate about is the sociology research I did last semester about the costs and benefits analysis of participating in the Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) and National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) under the context of studying in a primarily white institution (PWI). 

This project is important to me because compared to IFC, MGC, and NPHC have less presence on campus in terms of chapter size, housing, public recognition, etc. But the missions of MGC and NPHC resonate with me, which is providing a safe space for students of color and serving the community. I feel like their voice is seldom heard. That's why I want to initiate this project to get to know their missions and let their voice be heard.

The recruitment of participants is hard at the beginning due to the small chapter size, and it also takes great courage for students of color to share their experiences in a PWI. But I never hesitated to reach out and showed people that I am a safe space and why this project is important to me. 

I ended up speaking with 7 individuals from the councils. Through this process, I developed a better understanding of MGC and NPHC and was able to quantify those impacts in my paper. By presenting my finding at the southeastern undergraduate research symposium and publishing my paper in Emory undergraduate research journal, I hope MGC and NPHC can be heard by more people. ","Participating in case competitions is a way for me to express my creativity and solve a problem. During this process, I can solve a business problem, while channeling my creativity when designing exhibits. 

Last semester, I participated in the Project V Solutions case competition, in which I need to advise a soft-drink company to develop a new ESG product line. Revolving around ESG, I designed exhibits that demonstrate new sales channel, pricing strategies, comparable product analysis, and marketing plans. During the process, I make sure only use light green, yellow, and orange that best fits the theme. 

I am currently doing the IMA case competition that allows me to explore the hospitality industry. I am designing a performance measurement plan that can best measure different divisions' performance for senior managers within a hotel.

Overall, each case competition allows me to solve different problems while practicing my design skills.  ","Embracing the gentle sea breeze, I enjoy the sense of accomplishment every time we collect garbage picked up on weekends at the Shenzhen coastline. Though varying in age and occupation, within the small plogging team I initiated, members share a common enthusiasm, improving the hometown environment and our well-being at the same time.

What matters to me the most about this community is the bonding experience and the camaraderie we formed. I enjoy the small talk with people, listening to their retirement plans or their stories in this metropolitan. I also enjoy the genuineness we shared about improving our well-being and our surroundings. The friendly competition about who picks up the most garbage in the end always makes me giggle.

While plogging, I developed the ability to form a genuine relationship with people and the faith in ensuring a flourishing environment for personal growth.",,4.95,0.785,1.418,

EIIG has a reputation for creating long-lasting impacts on local entrepreneurs and ensuring their sustainable and persistent business growth. In highschool, many of the organizations I joined had the mission of supporting disregarded groups, whether that be bridging the gender gap or the wealth inequality present within my community. Not only would EIIG provide me with the opportunity to continue serving marginalized communities, but would also help me get my foot-in-the-door working on enlightening and stimulating real-life consulting cases. Especially during the pandemic, small businesses took a large hit, with profits declining immensely. I know how difficult small businesses had it during the pandemic because my mom owns her own practice, where she provides medical services in the form of Chinese medicine consulting. She experienced a great hit to sales as clients began withdrawing from her services due to quarantine and lockdown measures. She continued with remote services, but it was not the same. After some time, she received a small loan from my uncle and that’s when her business began to get back on track. Through this experience, I saw how crucial even a little bit of financial loans could help with getting a business owner back on their feet. EIIG would be the perfect opportunity for me to continue my passion of helping out those who need it the most, while getting hands-on experience in the world of consulting and investing. 
","My involvement in “Youth Empowerment Science” (‘YESci’), a Toronto-based organization dedicated to providing educational/professional STEM opportunities for youth, quickly transitioned from a curious event attendee to a passionate advocate and youth leader. As the Finance Director & Sponsorship Coordinator and later Head of Finance, I was responsible for the strategic fiscal planning for the 2021-2022 year, obtaining a steady stream of sponsorships, securing charitable donations, and managing our annual and monthly budgets. In this leadership position, I carried an immense amount of responsibility in ensuring our organization’s financial ability to provide free and accessible ongoing programming. Through my work with YESci, I have come to learn how essential access to information and resources are to creating equitable opportunities. Ensuring that every offering, from speaker events to student-run STEM conferences, was free and accessible to any youth is crucial to YESci’s vision. Our career events were a vital touchpoint for students to learn about diverse STEM occupations and gain information on critical career pathways. As a daughter of immigrant parents, I know firsthand how essential these programs are to providing direction and support to youth. Witnessing the impacts these relationships have had on youth was not only inspiring but has also informed me of my future steps in the pursuit of education. I seek to continue to dedicate myself not only to my personal studies but also to develop an expertise to engage as an individual who offers meaningful guidance and practical support for those who can benefit from it. 
","In highschool, I was an event trainer for Health Occupations Students of America (HOSA) in the nutrition category. My responsibilities were to organize lesson and program plans for members, and lead training lessons in preparation for the Fall and Spring Leadership Conferences (FLC & SLC). I also had to learn the content myself in order to teach proficiently. At first, I did not know how to tackle this responsibility as it was my first time instructing a group of people. To find the best technique for teaching, I created a survey to find out what learning strategies the students enjoyed/learned from best. I did not go with the typical powerpoint teaching method as I felt it was ineffective in helping them truly grasp the concepts. After receiving the poll results, I opted for plenty of diagrams, and mind-mapping for the visual learners, created a separate plan with interactive games for the kinesthetic students, and used the Feynman technique and active blurting for the auditory learners. These strategies catered to each student’s needs and added the greatest value to their understanding. I felt that students would be more willing to learn if they enjoyed the process of studying. When time came for the FLC and SLC, 3 of the students placed in the top 10, but those who didn’t rank still told me that they appreciated how I made learning enjoyable. I’m proud of the results, but more importantly the process and team effort that contributed to our success. 
","The fencing community back in Toronto has definitely impacted me greatly. There is just something unique about a sports community that stands out from other relationships and friendships. Whether it’s the constant encouragement from teammates, the inclusivity, or the extensive teamwork, I felt like a single puzzle piece in the entire puzzle, where everyone was brought together through the sport. Even in such a competitive setting, there was no animosity among fencers, which taught me the importance of taking mistakes and learning from them rather than sulking in defeat. Through fencing, I learned how to deal with adversity and accept losses with the support of my teammates. The competitive nature of this sport and the uplifting community truly pushed me to become better and better, improving my work ethic and allowing me to make strides towards bigger goals. I am now a more contributing member because of this community.

Fantasy football increased  this passion by revealing the excitement of deciphering the most valuable statistics and easily replaceable positions, allowing me to maximize production among my lineups. A few summers ago, I enrolled in a statistics program at the NY Times Summer Academy, creating my own metric to determine the outcome of NBA games, player rankings, team rankings, and the entire season. During the program, I learned that while statistical analysis is about predicting and even trying to control outcomes, there’s always a limit to how much we can actually know, do, or anticipate. There’s a degree of uncertainty in analytics, and to that end, the summer program taught me that statistics is less about predicting outcomes and more about analyzing data to make informed choices. 

Whether it’s through assessing business risks during due diligence, strategic planning analysis in the consulting sector, or general research, EIIG will allow me to continue to explore these freedoms and limits, and apply analysis and decision-making to real-world problems.

Additionally, EIIG is one of the only clubs at Emory that allows us to use finance and consulting skills to help marginalized groups. Further, the events outside of direct EIIG meetings fosters genuine, meaningful connections. After attending the interest meetings and hearing how passionate everyone was about the work at EIIG and the club as a whole, I knew I wanted to join this strong, tight-knit community. ","I am part of a nonprofit organization called Generation SOS (Sharing Our Stories) that empowers youth to make informed choices about substance use and other mental health issues. We bring in young, relatable sober speakers to share their story of recovery followed by a Q&A in hopes of opening up—and de-stigmatizing—the conversation around substance use, addiction, and mental health. Since many schools, including my high school, shy away from these important topics, I wanted to bring a Generation SOS meeting to my high school. I remember feeling very nervous about bringing such a taboo topic to my high school, fearing how my friends, peers, and faculty would react. 

The meeting, however, was a huge success. Following a robust Q&A, ten of my friends joined Generation SOS, and the health director at my school who attended the meeting loved our program so much that she has now incorporated it into the 9th grade health curriculum. I even had a close friend come up to the speaker after the meeting and share how he felt he may be going down a similarly tragic path. This meeting was meaningful to me because substance use and addiction is very close to home as my mom has been in recovery for 30 years, and I remember accompanying her to A.A. meetings throughout my childhood. This meeting brought those experiences full-circle and created an ever-lasting impact at my school with the club still remaining today—and I am in the process of bringing a meeting to the Emory community. ","During the pandemic, I joined Circle of Friends, a program in which young adults meet virtually with the children of essential workers. I volunteered to lead a Circle of Friends sports program for children ages 8-12, meeting over Zoom with 15 kids. Throughout our first few gatherings, the kids seemed just as nervous as I was; our workout routines and sports conversations felt stilted, even performative. 

On day three, I switched things up by adding a fun Kahoot trivia game, with an intense jeopardy-like feel, to that day’s itinerary. Suddenly, they were enthusiastic, outgoing, excited—and that new energy carried over to the workouts and conversation that followed. Now, the kids were eager to do longer, more challenging workouts. The conversation soon stretched beyond sports trivia to COVID’s impact on us all. A simple idea—implementing a Kahoot game—fostered open and comfortable conversation and connected us all during a time of isolation. ","From a young age, I fell in love with chess. I became obsessed with the infinite possibilities and the excitement of predicting my opponents’ moves. I befriended fellow chess players and recruited other friends to play. This obsession led me to become a nationally ranked top-100 chess player for ten-and-under. 

During the pandemic, chess.com helped me stay connected to others and freed me from my boredom. Regular games, and even tournaments with friends, returned a sense of normalcy for me. 

In times of change or isolation, chess is always there and always connects me to others. 

Throughout all these phases of my chess journey—elementary school, the pandemic, and even at Emory—chess and its surrounding community has taught me how to think in a logical, strategic manner and to plan out my “moves” ahead of time, whether that’s in relation to completing a long-term assignment, studying for a test, or simply planning out my day.

After talking to many EIIG members and executives during club fairs and interest meetings, I am excited to work with these many like-minded peers and join this passionate community. The research presentations on the past impact reports also intrigued me to conduct market and industry analysis within EIIG research teams.

The aim to promote the use of investments to create positive social and environmental change while generating financial returns caught my attention at first sight. Moreover, exploring my interests in the field and understanding the synergy between social performance and capital markets. EIIG’s projects perfectly mesh with my passion for impact investment and consulting areas and push me to learn more about the principles and practices behind the scene.","A pair of innocent eyes made contact with mine. Instantly, we entered a staring contest. When I could no longer keep myself from bursting into laughter, we both blinked and began laughing uncontrollably. Shuhan was a resident at The Little Fish Orphanage, a haven for developmentally challenged orphans.				

I became deeply attached to the children there. However, in a conversation with its founder, I learned that as a small, non-profit organization, it was unable to qualify for government funding, entirely relying on diminishing private donations. The orphanage was on the verge of closing.

Eager to help in any way possible, I founded Student Organization for Niche-Charity. I collaborated with my school's NHS to hold fundraisers for the charity’s short-term expenses. To raise awareness, we organized online campaigns and an exhibition for children’s art, which gained increased publicity and contacts with the local government. We also conducted thorough analyses of the charity’s finances to recommend operations plans, preventing two orphanages from permanent closure.

In the process of taking the initiative to resolve the orphanage’s financial problems, I realized that a crucial facet of leadership is empathy. Empathy for the children motivated me to embark on this journey. Empathy enables me to synthesize different perspectives—from orphanage founders to team members to volunteers. In turn, I can explore the essence of problems—beyond merely providing donations—to produce innovative yet feasible long-term solutions. My work has just begun, for I plan to dedicate myself to fighting for society’s most vulnerable. ","After years of grueling training, I was finally ready for my first fencing tournament. The game began. I was stunned when a fierce offensive fencer rushed toward me, but quickly realized that one defense strategy could be used against these continuous attacks. Controlling my pace, I studied her range of movements and pacing. One step, two steps, and a half! 2.5 seconds, her attacking speed. Next, jump, lunge! Every time her leg was ready to attack, her right foot would lift at 1.5 seconds. Anticipating her foil, I deflected her attack and returned with a riposte! 

Through fencing, I discovered my way to approach problems: I focus on constant observing and analyzing to develop a strategy and channel my creativity into seeking solutions. Armed with this knowledge, I’ve learned to confront challenges directly with rational thinking that releases my mind from the false conviction of uncertainty's indomitable power.","Before my grandparents began operating their online potato business, they rode wooden baskets hung on a chain to travel to the nearest village for sale.

My upbringing has ingrained in me a strong sense of community and a passion for uplifting those around me. It has also fostered my interest in financial services and shaped me into an aspiring social entrepreneur.

In the United States however, the microloan market has not yet reached critical mass, and there is still very low availability of loans for small businesses through traditional banks. There are smart, hard working people with great ideas all around us that simply need a small amount of capital and some direction to build a successful business. I want to help those people grow companies that create good jobs, leading to better neighborhoods, and ultimately better lives. 

Over 50% of new jobs in America are created by small businesses, so it’s imperative that we make it easier for small businesses to get the small loans and business assistance that they need to thrive. Many of those aspiring entrepreneurs are in underserved communities, some right here in Atlanta. By providing not only money, but business expertise and guidance, we can help those people and their families and communities prosper.

The people that I’ve met so far in EIIG are united and committed to that abundance mindset. It was obvious from the info session that EIIG is a close group of genuine people that care about lifting up everyone around them. I came to Emory to learn about business and make the world a better place, and I am confident that EIIG will provide an amazing team of driven friends and mentors who have the same goals.","In my junior year of high school, I joined the Investment Team at my high school, which was basically a club that analyzed what was happening in the stock market, and made investments from a practice account. Out of the entire club roster, only three of the members were female, including myself. The boys made the club more of a contest about who could make the most money instead of a learning experience like I was looking for. I felt a little bit out of place considering the ratio, and many of our other girl friends were hesitant to join because it was known as a boy’s club. Something needed to change, so in my senior year I became the co-founder of the Women’s Entrepreneurship and Business Club. We sponsored events such as resume workshops where we invited female guidance counselors to help, as well as Zoom meetings with successful women who shared about their experiences entering the daunting world of business and investing, and members could ask questions and get to know them. We gained over thirty members that first year, and the club continues to grow even today. I am passionate about this club because not only did it solidify my interest in business, but it is now a place where women can feel secure and develop confidence as they learn about the markets and the power of investing, entrepreneurship, and leadership. ","An event that could so easily have been avoided is all it took to destroy an entire generation of my father’s family. When my father was 11 years old, his brother drowned, and the consequences of what happened in that 10 minutes reverberate throughout my family today. That is why I swim, it is why I teach children to swim, and why I spend my summers as a lifeguard. Drowning is so very preventable, and I know that I’m making an impact with every kid I teach to stay safe in the water. Every year over 4,000 children in our country die by drowning. I know that I can’t change what happened in the past, but I do all I can to keep another family from experiencing the same horrific tragedy. It’s a problem that I’m proud to be helping to solve. ","Although I grew up in New York City, my mother is actually from Mississippi. I’ve spent many holidays and summers in the deep south, and it’s given me a unique perspective on business and life. My extended family still farms their property near Natchez, growing soybeans and corn, and raising cattle and chickens, but they are not anything like what most New Yorkers think of when they hear “farmers from Mississippi.” They are intelligent and savvy businesspeople, and knowing and spending time with them has opened up a whole world for me. Many issues relative to our energy resources, land management, and climate change are important to all of us, but especially critical to their businesses.

I am inspired by how the Emory Impact Investing Group is addressing this systemic issue and aligns with my personal mission of promoting equality of opportunity in business. Reading EIIG’s Women’s Access to Micro-loans, I learned more about the disparity in the amount of loans that men versus women receive due to the historical sexism in banking firms and difference in education regarding credit scores. As a current BBA student who will be at Emory for the next three years, I feel I can make a strong contribution to EIIG in a field that I am passionate about. My mindset and skills will be useful to EIIG. I am comfortable working with financial statements, numbers and ratios and detecting patterns to identify issues and opportunities. This skill is important when analyzing finances to solve problems in organizations. Looking at numbers and trends with a broader lens, I try to connect them back to the real world issue to create solutions. Having founded and run a club that taught music lessons to elementary school children who came from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, I recognize the power of investing energy to uplift communities. Experiencing the change first hand enables me to see this shift; I know that Emory Impact Investing is a great place for me to continue this journey.
","I have always loved music from my love of creating a new playlist to playing piano for the majority of my life. During the summer of my sophomore year, I was a counselor and taught piano at the Lawrenceville Performing Arts Camp (LPAC): a program where Lawrenceville students teach instruments and dance to children who qualify for the NJ State free lunch program. As the summer came to a close, I was disappointed that the children would have to wait a whole year until they could play instruments again. That following school year, I created and taught a program called “comPALS” to provide private music lessons for the LPAC campers throughout the year. I don’t believe in learning just for the sake of gaining information, but to use my acquired knowledge for the betterment of others. I have always loved playing the piano as it is an important place of solace in my life; I wanted to provide that opportunity to others. I am part of the society that I create, and I feel that there is no point in being a part of that society unless it is a just and fair place for everyone. It is my responsibility to use my energy to make it so.","I have kept a journal for most of my life and I have a book for every stage of my life. In elementary school, the journal was full of doodles; then in middle school, those doodles turned to writing about what I ate for lunch. I still keep a journal, tucked in my room, and it contains my innermost thoughts and is reflective. My diary acts as my therapist and a friend who is good at keeping secrets. My journals are a source of entertainment to read through my old entries and to reflect on what I thought were unsolvable problems. When I journal, I feel that it is a true reflection of my thoughts as I scribble down everything that I am thinking about, ignoring the grammar. Being able to express my reasoning enables me to navigate my challenges and ambitions to come up with a solution. 
","Throughout my childhood, my parents and I moved to many different countries and stayed for what seemed like only enough time to unpack our moving boxes. Hong Kong was a vibrant metropolis. Tokyo felt organized but claustrophobic. The English suburbs were quaint and proper, and finally, the United States was filled with the possibility I had imagined. The experience of moving to different countries and meeting a diverse group of people feeded my understanding that everybody has a different story. I feel that what defines me is my curiosity about others' stories; I love discovering other people’s lives and exploring their world. There are always new aspects to find out about the world and elements of myself when taking in these different experiences. Being thrust into so many cultural environments has honed my navigation skills and has made me a resilient person.

Micro-businesses account for 99.9% of all businesses in the United States, 20% of which don’t make it past two years. Concerning reasons why 45% of micro-businesses fail within the first five years is due to the lack of capital, limiting access to competent consulting services for setting up fundamental business plans. 

I am convinced that EIIG is the perfect organization for me. EIIG strives to take the available means to advocate sustainable growth of local micro-businesses. I was astonished by EIIG’s effort to provide short-term loans and consulting services to early-stage entrepreneurs that need it most. This is especially invaluable towards building a progressive and healthy community amid a currently repressive-economy. 

Apart from its mission, EIIG’s family-like community really stood out to me. Personally, the consulting initiatives aren’t just projects. They serve as opportunities for the development of both hands-on consulting experiences and personal relationships through collaborative projects.

In closing, EIIG is the community that I want to partake in and grow in. ","During my senior year, I served as the student body president. My graduating class and below were the first groups of students to fully return to school post pandemic. However, with the budget cuts set on extracurricular activities, STUCO had to organize several fundraisers to fund for traditional social events like pep-rallies, movie nights, talent shows, and homecoming dances. 

An experience that I remember the most is when I organized fundraisers for the senior retreat funds. Three months before the graduation, I attended the board of directors’ meeting and found out that my graduating class was only receiving half the budget the class two years prior had for their senior retreat. This caused major complications as we were significantly low on budget and time. The planning-process overlapped with finals and was further delayed due to budgeting issues. However, instead of canceling the retreat, I gathered the officers and class representatives and planned out a schedule for fundraisers we could carry out before graduation. 

As these initiatives only concerned our grade, STUCO wasn’t able to help. Therefore, my fellow representatives and I stayed after school hours to sell food and drinks at every scheduled event. This was my first fundraising experience independent from school organizations. From this experience, I learned the responsibility to invest time from my personal schedules in hopes for the greater good of the class and staying accountable whilst handling money. At the end, we were able to raise $4500+ and successfully go on the senior retreat.","Despite returning to offline learning for my junior year, all events were canceled. To enliven the school spirit during our slow recovery toward a post-pandemic era, I organized a TEDx event. Although the event was called off by school administrators several times, I stayed vigilant to provide the students with an enjoyable event. 

Due to safety protocols, 100 students was the cap for a single gathering. Hence, I suggested having the upperclassmen watch the event live while the rest of the student body watched through a livestream in respective classrooms. Moreover, I wanted to implement this event into the school’s office hours to prevent extracurricular disruptions. With this idea, the executives and I met with the administrators. After several negotiations, we were granted permission under strict regulations. Although an uncertain and stressful process, I learned how to adapt to change, utilize available resources, and organize a hybrid event. ","When I initially moved to South Korea, I felt disoriented due to the stark cultural difference. I had difficulties fitting in as I was unable to speak Korean well and there was little to no resemblance to my home: Maryland. This essentially left me pondering whether I belonged to my inherited ethnicity. 

This wasn’t until I found myself at home through my basketball team. What started as regular pick up games after school transitioned to traveling across Korea, competing against other varsity teams. Having been raised in the States, I considered myself only American. But my friends on the team shared similar backgrounds and experiences as I have. Going through the same hardships, they shared stories of how they slowly adapted to this cultural change. Little by little, I began to embrace Korean culture. Soon enough, I brought a diverse perspective to my community with my experiences as a Korean-American.",,4.8125,0.755,1.255,

Often, because of how costly it can be to build a successful business, it can feel like businesses-owners have to choose between creating positive social change or being successful. Impact investing gives people the power to grow their dreams and passions into flourishing businesses while making a positive social impact. I have always been passionate about diversifying and improving access to resources, whether in terms of outdoor recreational activities like fishing and birding (both hobbies that white men dominate), college applications, or even composting. Being a woman of color from a low-income family, I have experienced first-hand the ways in which things like race, class, and gender directly affect my day-to-day life. The knowledge and opportunity gap that has existed and continues to exist in low-income neighborhoods, in communities of color, for women in business, is undoubtedly an important issue to address. Few organizations at Emory address these issues, and fewer still for organizations relating to business. But having witnessed the tangible impact of EIIG in the Emory community as well as people in our broader community (I <3 Carrot Dog), I am excited to have the opportunity to be part of a socially conscious organization that works to strengthen our local community and empower business owners from all walks of life. 
","This past year I’ve been working at Emory’s Center for Women as a Student Programming Assistant. In the center, my primary project is to help lead the Emory Women in Wilderness cohort, which is a program created to give opportunities for queer and BIPOC women to experience the outdoors and outdoor recreation. Many women in these communities didn’t grow up with families who went camping or fishing, or doing many outdoor activities, so this program is a way for them to engage with the outdoors with a group of women who share their same identity. It’s been really exciting for me to be able to lead the Women in Wilderness program; I’ve planned two hikes this past semester, and am in the process of planning the events for this upcoming semester. It’s been really rewarding to be able to pass along outdoor knowledge that I have picked up from the limited experiences that I have had in the outdoors, and I’ve really loved connecting with other women of color and empowering them to be comfortable doing things like cook using a camping stove, or set up a tent, or even just go on a hike that’s a few miles long. I’m so happy to have the opportunity to get more women of marginalized identities into outdoor spaces and feel like they have the knowledge and tools they need to succeed and have a good time in the great outdoors. ","The year was 2019, and I had just joined my school’s environmental club, working to implement composting in our dining hall. Though we had been met with enthusiasm, people were not composting properly. We were getting reports of forks, tinfoil, and other non-compostable items ending up in the compost. Something needed to be done. We knew that no one would want to listen to a boring presentation about the impact of composting, so we brainstormed an engaging and unique way to bring light to our cause. Our solution? A ten minute presentation full of pig memes and gifs including Peppa Pig). Since our compost was being used for pig feed, we thought it would help to drive our message home. We created our slides and presented. Somehow, our plan worked. Composting efficiency increased drastically, and we were able to divert over 20 tons of food waste from landfills that year. ","Not many people can say they spent their summer working in a National Park, but somehow, this past summer I found myself situated in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado (ROMO). Considering I was quite literally the youngest person working in the entirety of the park, it was definitely an interesting experience. While working at ROMO, I made it my personal project to increase access to local communities that face barriers to outdoor recreation and the outdoors. Through community programs and partnerships I was able to get a firsthand experience with the ins and outs of how to engage with and build community while balancing resources, time, and the experiences of the people I was working with. I hope to now bring these experiences to EIIG and assist in building relationships and local businesses as I continue to strengthen and develop my skills and my community. ",,4.75,0.746,1.259,

At the end of each project to build affordable housing for the less fortunate people, he assured me how fulfilling and rewarding the experience had been. I knew he was talking about what he could do for them, for society. This is the type of social entrepreneurship I envision for my future: the vision that puts others’ lives before oneself, that commits what one has into what one can give to others. And this is why I found EIIG to be my perfect fit.

As an aspiring social entrepreneur, I was deeply impressed by EIIG's mission to use its abilities to make meaningful impacts on the community in which we live and benefit from. Among the countless business clubs at Emory, what stood out to me about EIIG was their careful process of reaching underprivileged entrepreneurs and their sincere effort in building personal relationships with their clients. Whenever I spoke with the team, I could feel their passion for their work, which made me strongly desire to be a part of and work with them. Having been raised and taught to give back to society throughout my life, I genuinely appreciate EIIG's movement to create value and improve our community. Therefore, I would be grateful for the opportunity to start my first step as a social entrepreneur at EIIG.
","Although I believe myself to be well read and written, I still feel like a foreigner sometimes when it comes to subjects related to language or writing. Math, however, has its own appeal for its organized and ruled nature. What I particularly like about math is the complex but intricately designed structure of the study: there are numerous methods to solve a single problem, which usually leads to one definite answer.

There are no specific clubs or school activities that were directly related to math, but I always had a passion for learning and sharing what I learned. Granted, I believe that teaching is one of the best ways to study, since teaching requires a complete understanding of the concept. During my junior year, I posed myself to be a teacher of those who were struggling in class. I enthusiastically shared what I knew by providing peers tutoring sessions after school. Also, I have three younger siblings, including my cousin who lives next to my house. They all come to me for help whenever they have problems with math, and of course I happily help them expand the breadth of their knowledge.

Tutoring was both a joyful and meaningful experience for me, allowing me to combine my passion for math with my desire to help people in my community. As an aspiring social entrepreneur, I am certain that my strong foundation in math and inspiration in the mechanics of the subject will create an impact on our community.
","As a student who is keenly aware of the devastation of inequality, economic or otherwise, and who strove to put some legwork to address it, I decided to “donate” my birthday to underprivileged children. For me, fundraisers felt hackneyed. Charity concerts seemed overtly performative. I understood I couldn’t improve the children’s lives overnight. Even so, I wanted to have a lasting impact on their lives, with an adequate shelf-life, in meaningful ways. And I intuited memories can last forever. Especially for children, the fun, the exhilaration, the energy of birthday parties could be formative, and even transformative. So, I have been throwing birthday parties on my birthday for 3 years. I contacted local orphanages, networked with the teachers to gather children whose birthdays happened to be in the same month as mine, and organized a surprise party for them.","After my initial college admission failed, I joined the military as a new opportunity. The experience was vastly different from anything I had encountered before. I was exposed to diverse socioeconomic backgrounds among my fellow soldiers, realizing my privilege in my learning environment and how easily I had given up on my previous goals. This realization made me commit to promoting social equity and equal opportunities for all individuals. My experience there also motivated me to utilize my free time to prepare for my second college application, leading to my acceptance into Emory University. It has been a year since I was discharged from the military, but it is always enjoyable to reminisce and talk about our times back then. Eighteen months in the military not only presented various challenges but also served as a valuable experience that has formed my persistence and determination.",,4.375,0.664,0.836,
2023-01-26 10:53:58.879,R,,pre bba ,Freshman,Asian,Both,"I am interested in joining Emory Impact Investing Group for one of two reason. Firstly, I value the notable mentorship and personal development this club provides. I am one to enjoy working closely with like-minded people to achieve a common goal, while being mentally stimulated and challenged. This club provides an opportunity for me to learn how to help the beginning stages of  small businesses today as well as enhance my knowledge of the investment industry. Secondly, I hope to make a positive impact on this community by helping small businesses achieve their goal of living out the American Dream through financing. As a child of two immigrants from China, I have had a first hand account of what many small businesses had to endure. When my parents came to the United States in search of relief and some sort of financial stability, their “American Dream” was owning a small business, like most. They struggled with early-stage financing and sustaining the growth of a business. I was able to see first hand the difficulty of getting that money to fulfill a dream they had for years. As a child, it is hard to see your parents go through difficult times like these. Looking back to this time, I wish I could have been the financial advisor who helped guide them to live out their realities. I view all people like my parents. Struggling, but hardworking. I want to reinstate the American Dream for all individuals, so their hard work and talents can be recognized. ","A project that I was truly passionate about was called GenZ for Green. This was a non-profit organization that focused specifically on helping the environment, whether this be through educating the public on the detrimental effects of climate change or actually taking initiative to make a difference. Learning about the urgency of climate change and all the human causes of it really inspired me to reach out to people and actually take initiative to start something that mattered to me. I feel that it is important to urge this generation to take action before it is too late. I want to be able to be able to sustain Earth as long as possible to help future generations. By educating others, we can preserve resources that need to be sustained, instead of depleting it. To make an impact, I created a press release about a compost garden and worked with three other people to build a community compost at Gilcrease Orchards, a popular orchard in Las Vegas, Nevada. By creating a community compost and placing it with a lot of human traffic, it can captivate the attention of others and motivate people to actually use this compost. By utilizing it, it will provide us with greener neighborhoods and healthier soil, which benefits the environment. ","A way I’ve been able to express myself creatively to problem solve is to always offer solutions to the table and not defer ideas automatically. One solution may sound implausible at first, but it can turn into a striking solution upon further research and thought. By not eliminating ideas right away, it enables me to deep dive into the problem, instead it sitting on the surface level. I utilized this problem solving tactic in a lunch fundraising debacle. There was one vendor we wanted to optimize profit, but they couldn’t keep up with demand. Our solutions were to not do it at all, or choose a vendor that didn’t yield much profit. Automatically, many wanted to rule out the other vendor, but I pondered on that idea, and realized profit is profit, no matter how much we make. I gave my pitch and it turned out perfectly in the end. ","A community that has shaped part of my identity would be a club I was introduced to in high school called FBLA. Never did I ever think that I could find my voice and be heard. FBLA was much more than a business oriented club, but a place where I could feel at home and learn more about what I loved, which was about the business sector mainly due to my parents’ restaurant. With my new-founded voice, I worked to enhance my skills and empower others. Little did I know that developing these skills would later lead me on the path to finding my aspirations. I practiced public speaking and later implemented these skills on the state level, where I competed in events like Financing and Business Communications.

As a first year student, I look forward to joining the EIIG community to help enrich the lives of individuals in the Atlanta area. The first thing that enticed me to EIIG is the ""impact"" the club has on all parties. In college, I want to be able to make a positive impact on someone else's life, and I feel that EIIG can do that for me in both an academic and social way. Additionally, as a Pre-BBA student, I look forward to utilizing my current business knowledge and also significantly growing my business understanding. As a part of EIIG, I hope to learn a lot of new skills that I can personally utilize in the real world. Whether this be collaboration with small businesses or working on early-stage finance, these are skills that I can apply to any career.

","After I stopped playing baseball, I still wanted to stay connected with the sport. I saw no better opportunity than helping the Challengers division at my local Little League. The Challengers division is composed of individuals with disabilities who sometimes need a little bit of extra help to play baseball. Every Friday afternoon, I would finish school and go to my local baseball fields where I would then help the team practice. Whether that involved me throwing a baseball with someone or running the bases with them, I felt that I was having an impact. Oftentimes, my most important times were not baseball related, however. Many weeks, I would show up to the field and play in the outfield with Sarah. Sarah really looked up to me, and we were able to build a bond where she felt comfortable with me to share some of her family struggles which we were able to discuss and work through together. With other teammates, I constantly received thank you's from the players and their parents for my small gesture that helped brighten everyone's day and ensure that the players were safe and having fun on the baseball field.   ","In high school, my graphic design teacher often looked at art from a single perspective. Since this was my first time taking a formal art class, this frustrated me because oftentimes, I did not conform to the ""single"" style. However, I was determined to find a compromise and demonstrate my skills from many perspectives. As the year was coming to a close, we were assigned a final exam in which we had free-choice over what to do. Therefore, I created a final assignment that showed the same picture but from many different perspectives. My goal with this was to demonstrate that people can look at the same thing from different perspectives, but still see the same thing. No one perspective is better or worse, however they are all just slightly different. ","I find my Jewish background to be an important part of who I am today. Growing up, my synagogue was a place that I felt accepted and was able to build meaningful friendships. It was also there that I was able to learn the many values including honesty, building a community, and giving back to those in need. To me, these are three of the reasons that I have participated in programs with the Anti-Defamation League. I have aligned myself with the ADL because I believe it is important to combat hate against all people, no matter a person's background.

In this program, I work with my mentee on skills such as resume crafting, interview skills, and public speaking skills. This program is important to me because I am able to provide guidance and support as my mentee navigates through different aspects of life, such as employment and social interactions, while he simultaneously teaches me so much.

Being a mentor has had a significant impact on my own personal growth. I have gained valuable skills in communication, patience, and empathy. I also have a greater understanding and appreciation for the unique challenges that individuals with autism face on a daily basis.

Through SPARK Mentoring, I am able to play a small but meaningful role in my mentee's life. It is an incredibly rewarding experience to see my mentee’s growth and progress over time. I am proud to be a part of such a valuable program that has truly become the highlight of my week.","During my junior and senior years of high school, I worked at a marketing firm as a digital marketing specialist. At my job, I was tasked with increasing engagement for one of our client's social media platforms, whose growth had plateaued. The client was a child chef who sold cookware and tools to get children to learn to cook. After conducting research, I noticed that the company's target audience was primarily other kids with similar platforms who were looking to engage with our client. So, I came up with an idea to create a social media campaign that featured other child entrepreneurs each week.

First, leadership because as a counselor communicating effectively, making tough decisions, and solving problems is a huge part of the job. Second, empathy because I formed close relationships with campers and learned how to understand and relate to their perspectives and feelings.

My brief conversation with Edmund at the club fair about the work EIIG does and the supportive community within the club convinced me this club is the right fit for me. EIIG stood out to me amongst other business-related clubs due to its emphasis on building personal connections with local businesses and its mission to support entrepreneurs from underprivileged communities. While other clubs primarily advise established companies, EIIG helps startups that may not have access to loans and advice. I have come to understand that starting a business is a challenging endeavor, so the guidance and support provided by EIIG to local startups is thus vital for them to thrive. Throughout high school, I have been actively seeking ways to give back to my community and other underprivileged communities in the country through initiatives such as tutoring elementary school students in the DC area and volunteering at local hospitals. Joining EIIG would allow me to continue pursuing this passion while gaining deeper insights into my interests in investing."," During the pandemic, my mom and I decided to use our spare time to create a small company on Etsy where we sold handmade products. Despite our lack of experience, we were excited and determined to make this endeavor successful.
We quickly realized that building a business required far more than just utilizing our creativity to create products. We had to learn everything from scratch - from setting up a website, social media accounts, and advertising to mastering the nuances of e-commerce.
Though the initial stages were overwhelming, there were plenty of online resources to help us. I found myself fully immersed in the process, taking charge of marketing, reaching out to local stores, signing up for craft fairs, and communicating with potential customers.  I constantly searched for better ways to improve our operations and worked hard to make the purchasing process as simple as possible for buyers.
This project not only pushed us out of our comfort zones but also brought us closer together as a team. It helped me connect with my hometown community, as I started joining events and speaking to citizens all over town, trying to get the word out. Although these were not my products, I am grateful for the opportunity to have tried my hand at marketing and to have discovered the thrill and constant learning that comes with entrepreneurship."," As a freshman in high school, I took the initiative to establish the French Club. It started gaining popularity during my sophomore year, but unfortunately, COVID struck in the middle of that year, and like every other club, we had to go online. Instead of caving to the temptation of shutting down the club, I persevered and got creative, thinking of ways in which the club could thrive in this remote setting. I reached out to french schools nearby to organize a pen pal exchange, started a fundraiser, hosted cooking lessons and tutoring sessions over zoom, and implemented various other engaging activities to keep members invested. While some ideas were more successful than others, I enjoyed using my creativity and personally connecting with members to make this new experience as enjoyable and rewarding as possible for everyone. "," The community that played the most significant role in shaping my identity these past few years has been my orchestra community.

While it was a competitive environment, people sought to better themselves rather than compete with each other., something I really admired. Watching my peers work tirelessly to improve their skills was a source of inspiration, encouraging me to put in the time and effort to become a better violinist for the ensemble as a whole.

I am extremely interested in how the intersection of finance and data can be utilized to give entrepreneurs accessible opportunities for them to achieve success and give back to their community. 
Now living in the community that these entrepreneurs look to directly impact, I hope to become involved in EIIG to actively participate in growing our local micro-businesses.  The unique access to building relationships with entrepreneurs and the excitement to apply my problem-solving skills makes EIIG stand out to me.

During my first exposure to how small businesses operate, I was able to research the barriers to growth that they commonly undergo. This research project opened my eyes to a foundational issue: without resources or funding to invest into technology and labor, small businesses are often overlooked by a community because of larger, advanced businesses. It is especially saddening for me to see the lack of support for small businesses because of their commitment to giving back to marginalized communities and creating a social impact, like Rochelle Porter’s environmental awareness. 

Completing this research project was the first step: it broadened my awareness on the common obstacles that entrepreneurs face and enhanced my interest in finding creative solutions specific to local, small businesses. Joining EIIG will give me numerous opportunities to implement my creative strategies and analytical approaches to help solve the problems I have researched.","During high school, my interest in current events expanded. I had a passion for conversing with others to understand their views: it made me more open-minded and developed my critical-thinking skills. But, this also opened my eyes to the polarization in our nation and, in general, the lack of political discussions within my community. My newfound awareness motivated me to create my own publication dedicated to educating, facilitating discussions, and finding creative ways to be an activist in our society. 

I wanted my publication to be used as a tool for people to learn how to make impacts in society, even if it was something as small as starting a conversation with someone who thinks differently than you. Additionally, I hoped to grow the team working for the publication to diversify the types of writers publishing articles and create a more open environment. 

Expanding this publication was so important to me because I wanted it to be a form of bipartisanship. For example, I encouraged collaboration by hosting monthly meetings where we openly talked about what interested us the most that month. Although this publication only reached a small group of people, I marketed this publication through word of mouth, increasing the number of viewers per month and broadening the impact it had on my community. I reached my objective of incentivizing conversations and building bridges with the intent of solving problems rather than creating them.","Tutoring was one of my favorite activities: it was fulfilling to see that lightbulb moment when the concepts came together. I initially volunteered to tutor high schoolers in math where we’d simply go over problems. 

When I started my own tutoring company designed for younger students, I realized their attention span was weak, making it difficult to use previous strategies. I needed to simplify concepts from my current knowledge while implementing creative approaches to keep them engaged. For math, I taught examples using visuals, by showing calculations through drawings. I also made up problems on the whiteboard and had them walk me through how to solve them, creating a more interactive environment. During reading, they read out loud while I created questions to test comprehension, enabling conversation-based sessions.  

Tutoring a different age group forced me out of my comfort zone because I had to experiment with different strategies. ","Dance has always been an insecurity of mine. I never thought joining a Bollywood Club to perform a dance at an Asian Festival would be a factor that has shaped the confidence I have now. 

After performing this dance and reflecting on it, I’ve seen the growth in my personality. It made me realize that I will always have moments where I am uncomfortable, but rather than harping on this, I should find ways to overcome it and make the best of any situation. More specifically, it was a space that helped me find my love for dance. It taught me the importance of living in the moment and not constantly worrying about how I was perceived by others.

As I continued to learn more about the investing world, I realized the importance of making a social impact through investing rather than just for financial gain. During the pandemic, I witnessed many small local businesses go bankrupt because they didn’t have the necessary resources to survive. As the president of Keystone Club at my local Boys and Girls Club, I tried my best to help those businesses affected by leading various projects such as handmaking hundreds of masks to donate to first responders. Although we might have slightly helped these businesses in the short run, I couldn’t help but think of the larger problem at hand: capital. If these small businesses had enough capital/funding to navigate through the pandemic, they wouldn’t be in need of others’ donations. Emory Impact Investing Group provides small businesses like these access to that capital. Charging extremely low-interest rates on the loans it gives out as an alternative to the unnecessarily high-interest rates the government charges makes acquiring capital for local micro-businesses much more accessible. 
EIIG helps for the sake of helping, and not for financial gain. I want to be a part of that. I hope to help EIIG close the micro-business gap and continue to research more ways to help small businesses in Atlanta flourish.
","During my first semester here at Emory, I was fortunate enough to be able to join Emory Consult Your Community and have the opportunity to provide free consulting services to predominantly minority and women-owned small businesses in Atlanta. The engagement I worked on was Carla’s Boutik, which I pleasantly came to find out during the EIIG info session is also one of the businesses that EIIG has been working closely with. 
	Carla’s mission specifically stood out to me because she promoted products of globally diverse styles from designers all around the world. Many of these designers would never have had a chance to have their products sold if it weren't for Carla’s help. I highly resonated with Carla’s mission as creating opportunities for underserved groups of people is something I’ve always been passionate about.
	When consulting for Carla’s Boutik, I worked with my team member Calvin on the marketing scope. We worked primarily on redesigning Carla’s website and improving her social media marketing strategies. As for Carla’s website, we created a mockup tool bar that made it easier for the user to navigate and be able to shop for what they wanted. For Carla’s social media, we provided recommendations on how to improve feed consistency, quality of posts, and optimize engagement. We also provided Carla with a step-by-step guide on how to start marketing on Tik Tok to possibly gain a new demographic. Consulting for Carla was definitely one of the highlights of my semester. 
","In my junior year of high school, our Keystone Club failed to meet its fundraising goals, the first time we had failed in the past 10 years. Even worse, I was the one in charge of fundraising. Our primary fundraiser, Snack Shack, failed miserably. 
Instead of giving up, I focused on how I could revamp our snack shack for the next year. I started by conducting a survey for the kids at the Boys and Girls Club to determine the most popular snacks. Moreover, I reached out to Hoop Code Basketball Academy and Avalanche Volleyball, partners with our Club, to see if we could do Snack Shack at their events. After negotiating the logistics, we were doing Snack Shack at all Hoop Code and Avalanche events on top of doing it every day at the Boys and Girls Club. Our Keystone ended up well exceeding our fundraising goals that year.

Stereotypes are stereotypes for a reason, right? Growing up as an Asian basketball player in a predominantly white community, I oftentimes felt out of place. At the gym, I was usually the only Asian and always the last person chosen for teams. Nobody thought I was any good.
Basketball became more than just a game, it became a place for me to break the stereotype. Early morning pickup games, late-night shooting sessions, and countless hours of ball-handling work all made me more confident as a player. I went on to become the captain of our high school’s varsity basketball team.
Becoming a coach for Hoop Code allowed me to help others grow both physically and mentally through basketball. For two years, I have coached over 600 players of all ages to become better student-athletes. I hope to empower the next generation of basketball players to break their own stereotypes.",,3.8541666666666665,0.56,0.386,

As a non-profit executive director, I personally understand the value of providing support to businesses operating with limited funding, and subsequently, the impact of obtaining such capital. I would be honored to distribute financing and provide consultation through Emory Impact Investing Group membership. 

My organization started as a local high school club, and with careful planning and community support, grew to an international and incorporated entity. I would like to provide those in high-poverty neighborhoods with an opportunity to establish and develop their micro-businesses, developing both a personal and professional connection to their mission. Additionally, I am eager to relay my insight from an experienced standpoint and via research analysis which I have previously engaged with to support my non-profit. 

Diversity is integral for business success. However, systemic barriers to business success like education inequity disproportionately impact people belonging to marginalized groups.  For this reason, there is a lack of diversity among the leaders of small and large businesses alike. It is essential to prioritize this atmosphere by working with entrepreneurs that are women, people of color, Queer and/or disabled and assist them in addressing business concerns from a barrier-informed standpoint, a unique trait of EIIG. As someone who exists at the intersection of all of the aforementioned identities, I believe that my perspective can contribute to this group effectively and with care. ","In September, I was nominated to serve on One Georgia’s Disability Council, an advocacy initiative affiliated with Stacey Abrams’ campaign for governor. It sought to ensure that the policy agenda of Leader Abrams intended to fulfill the promises of the ADA: equal opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency. Each week, I attended meetings alongside fellow disabled activists to provide feedback and ideas regarding efforts to engage disabled potential voters and make campaign efforts accessible. I engaged with universities in Georgia to promote civic engagement among disabled youth. Through this experience, I was able to connect with other disabled folks and ensure our representation in the election. The position also gave me the opportunity to meet Leader Abrams and thank her for her service to Georgia. As someone who does not appear to be disabled and therefore did not grow up with a constant awareness of accessibility, it was a unique and informative experience to ensure equity in an often underrepresented manner. ","During my senior year of high school, I worked with a company called Blue Fever. The company is a platform that promotes social and emotional well-being through anonymous journaling. I was tasked to promote self-love via leading a journal. It was through this experience that I was able to alleviate the self-depreciation of others through words and language. The mere articulation of a personal struggle or the graduation from that struggle assisted thousands in sharing their stories with one another. It was a collective effort. Myself and others used images, poetry, prose, colors, music, and more to promote the cause and solve the problem of self-hatred. It was not a foolproof solution, but it had a visibly positive impact. ","When my grandparents immigrated to this country from Cuba, they fled political persecution. At the time, they hardly spoke English and had approximately $150 to their name. Navigating their new lives in the United States took confidence, patience, and courage. Rather than being naturally accustomed to cultural norms that citizens from birth would grasp effortlessly, they learned by experience. Growing up in a predominantly white area and with a white mother, I wasn’t comfortable embracing my Latino identity. But, for the past several years, my curiosity and appreciation for my Cuban heritage has outweighed my desire to assimilate with white culture. My family members inspire me to embrace this community. My dad’s sister works to ensure Latino equity for a living. Another one of my aunts works in the government navigating refugee policy. My grandparents are two of the most important people in my life, and listening to their experience as refugees is vital to understanding them. This community strengthens my familial bond.

2023-01-26 21:40:27.016,R,,BBA,Freshman,Asian,Both,"As my own father was once an owner of a small start-up business himself when I was a little boy, I am well aware of the struggles small businesses go through when they are in their start-up phase. In fact, although my father successfully developed his small photography studio into a quite large commercial image-making business with sheer will and a spoonful of luck, I have also seen a lot of his close friends who were like loving uncles to me completely fail or go bankrupt multiple times after starting up many types of small businesses, mainly due to a severe lack of financial assets & administrational knowledge. Fast forward to today, I am a pre-BBA student that will join the Goizueta Business School in my sophomore year, and I am facing opportunities that can not only offer me the experience of getting involved in the real world of business but also help out owners of local small businesses that are just like those “uncles” who bought me toys and candy when I was a little boy. As EIIG aims to eliminate the micro-business gaps in impoverished areas in Atlanta by helping out small businesses by granting them initial access to capital, I thought it could be one of those opportunities where I can contribute towards myself and the local community that I will commit myself to during my time here at Emory as a Business student.  ","In high school, I translated “United Nations: Guide to Model UN,” which is a Model UN guidebook officially published by the United Nations Dept of Global Communications with a team of 5 other translators from English to Korean and publish the book in the Korean book market for the premise of familiarizing South Korean students to the concept of Model United Nations and even English education in general, as Korean educational institutions often lack the resources to provide students with those types of education. I also planned to give away 50 copies that I received after translating for a local Korean middle school. The process was definitely not easy. Despite the fact that I was fluently bilingual at the time, it was my first time translating an English book and the complex terms of MUN made it very challenging for me to translate nearly a hundred pages of rules and procedures. However, as I was privileged enough to receive international education and learn English way more than average Koreans of my age, I felt the responsibility to help my people and my country take another step into the International community, which is why the completion of this project brought me a sense of patriotism and satisfaction. In fact, it was by far the most meaningful extracurricular project I’ve done until this day.","	It was a steaming hot Monday in June 2021 with the thermometer showing 96.8°F. I was working a part-time job at a street food joint inside a subway station in Seoul that sells Korean pastry products. The joint had a summer-time special ice cream menu, but not a single ice cream order was being received. I couldn’t find answers to this oddity until I found a dusty old ice cream picket in the storage room that read: “Cold & Tasty Ice Cream!” in giant letters that the joint owner never used because it looked ‘corny’. Then I realized that our busy customers never look at our full menu with small letters; I immediately placed the picket in front of the joint. 2 hours later, the joint made nearly $150 by selling $2.5 ice cream cones. Since then, I tend to seek solutions by considering every other perspective but mine.","Although I have a very diverse group of friends and I never limit myself to meeting and hanging out with certain types of people, the community that influenced me the most is definitely the Smith Hall 3rd Floor community. In fact, I think we are one of the very few floors in all Emory freshman residence halls where almost all residents are tight with each other. Having arrived at Emory straight from South Korea, I started limiting myself to the people of my own nationality; I was a coward for cultural differences. The diverse Smith 3 community really helped me step out of my comfort zone and gave me the opportunity to socialize with many different types of people. Hence, throughout semester one, I learned how to view people and further the world without prejudice, and how to approach people who have backgrounds completely different from my own.

However, now I am ready to involve myself. EIIG will not only help me make a social impact, but also develop my professional skills.
I am specifically interested in the due diligence committee especially because it uses quantitative analysis to determine whether businesses will be able to pay back the loan. I have been wanting to experience the quantitative side of business and this is a perfect opportunity to do so.
Additionally, the businesses EIIG works with actually implements EIIG's ideas. Since these businesses are mostly in Atlanta, physically seeing the ideas I had come to fruition seems very exciting. Also because my dad is a small business owner, I saw he had to work harder due to his lack of connections and capital as an immigrant. EIIG's mission to close the micro-business gap resonates with me. I know my dad would have greatly benefitted from EIIG's services, and the thought of being able to do that for others is a full circle moment. 
Lastly, the culture of EIIG seems very inclusive and genuine. I always see the EIIG members in a library study lounge hanging out, and the fall retreat seemed like a very great experience to bond. Seeing that you guys hang out outside of regular GBMs makes me confident that this is a community I want to join.","In high school, I worked at a tutoring center where I taught students math and english. The job itself was relatively mundane, but I enjoyed teaching children, developing an aptitude for patience and communication. Although I've worked with many students, one in particular who had just come from Korea particularly is memorable to me. Her mom had come in wanting to sign her up when my boss was not there, so I helped her through the enrollment process with my limited professional Korean speaking skills. When her daughter came in for class, I noticed that she was extremely shy and was very unwilling to participate in the curriculum. So, I worked with her one-on-one as I could converse with her in Korean and was a more experienced employee. She was very timid, but with a little bit of coercion and lots of complimenting, she quickly gained more confidence throughout the weeks. After a while, she was not only doing a great job with phonetics, she was even trying to engage in off-topic conversations that I had to redirect. I believe that many of your experiences from when you were younger shape your future interactions and I wanted to give her confidence, as I know what it is like to feel different from peers. This experience highlighted the value of aiding others with the skills I have and believing in their capabilities, helping them reach their full potential.","In high school I was senior class president, in charge of planning prom. Due to the pandemic we got approval to have a prom four months in advance, a much shorter time frame than usual. I was so stressed!
Initially, I assigned my team members a task for the week and expected them to report what they found, but every week I was met with disappointment as they would not pull their weight.
Instead of randomly assigning tasks, I meaningfully allocated tasks based on their interests. For example, I asked the artsy girl to make flyers, I asked the cheerleader to brainstorm a fundraiser, and I asked the guy who liked music to contact a DJ and create a playlist. This immediately changed their attitudes and they excitedly reported back.
This experience taught me that leadership means being adaptive and sometimes taking tasks that others do not want to do.","By playing in orchestra since 6th grade, I have learned self-discipline, teamwork, and how to look beyond the surface.
Firstly, in a team all members have to be thriving. If only I sound good, it doesn't mean the orchestra sounds good, and I have to pull my weight because even one person can ruin it for everyone.
Secondly, I generally hated practicing and never did it. However, orchestra was somewhere I would directly see the impact of not working hard - I would be seated in the back. This caused me to realize that I have to be diligent and self disciplined to reap rewards.
Lastly, simply playing notes does not mean you are making music. This community has helped me accept that things are not always black and white. I have to really dive deep and work hard to understand people, concepts, and the world around me",,3.8125,0.549,0.317,
2023-01-27 08:16:03.184,R,,OAM & Chemistry ,Sophomore,Asian,Both,"For much of my higher-education, I openly expressed distain for business clubs. They exuded an aura of arrogance and highbrow that left a bad taste in my mouth. Of course, I acknowledge my criticism is largely unfounded and based in personal opinions. However, when I approached EIIG at the business fair and reviewed the interest meeting slides, I found myself nodding my head and connecting with its mission. 

Rather than taking up space/time, EIIG gives. Given our privileged position in business school, this is what distinguishes this club for me v.s. other consulting/investing clubs. Rather than generating returns/wealth for our own endowment or consulting for large businesses for name recognition, I want to join EIIG because the club recognizes the intrinsic value of supporting small businesses to help others rather than just itself. 

Of course, I also acknowledge that I hope to join EIIG to gain applicable skills. While I have past consulting experience, I'm exploring research experience especially in the data analytics (DART) and Primary Data Collection (PDART). EIIG has a unique spread of business intersections; it's an amazing opportunity for me to discover my passion and interest during my time at the Business School. Furthermore, I trust Kathy Yu's judgement! I met her at Oxford in ACC and she's always been very warm towards me. As an Oxford Continueé this semester, I deeply appreciate her reaching out to me whenever she sees me. ","In fall semester, I begin interning at Journal for Emerging Investigators (JEI), a non-profit focused at providing mentorship to middle/high school students seeking to publish their scientific research. JEI is not a glamorous organization; started by an Oxford College professor in 2011, JEI only has two paid employees and relies almost exclusively on volunteers to operate. This intimate business model allowed me to work directly with the executive director, Scott Soldat-Valenzuela, to initiate projects. As such, the work I did (with another intern) felt much more meaningful/impactful to the organization. 

For example, I identified 30 schools in lower-income areas and communicated with their science teachers to recruit students into JEI. I utilized my past experience at Everview Consulting Club and used PolicyMap to conduct this research. This project was meaningful for two reasons. FIrst, the aspect of able to apply my past experience in a new context excited me and allowed me to see my own growth. Second, I saw tangible impact of my work because for a small organization, even little projects like this are hughly consequential to the mission. My partner and I conducted the entire stream of communication: researching, drafting letters, and sending. And out of the the 30 schools, we successfully corresponded with 5 teachers. In raw terms, I made only a small difference. But, to me, it was an impact nonetheless and I believed in the purpose of my work. 
","The question of creativity in problem solving will always circle back to my experiences teaching/coaching. 

In 2021, I taught at Breakthrough Minneapolis as a Science Teaching Fellow, creating my own 7-week curriculum on plant science and leading 2-3 classes per day. I learned quickly that no matter how meticulous I prepare a lesson plan, it will never play out the ""right"" way. 

For example, during the first few days of class, my students were still warming up to me. I needed to find a way to get them to speak to one another and feel comfortable in the classroom. I had this brilliant idea (from buzzfeed) to start a gratitude board. Each day before class, each student will write down 2-3 gratitudes on a designated whiteboard space that they keep for the semester. 

Yes, it was cheesy. But we got some beautiful drawings, affirmations, and funny jokes each day. ","My family. As much as I hate to admit, my family is the my compass for everything that I do. My parents taught me to value education – for education sake – always strive to learn regardless of the topic or future applications. My younger sister, Annabeth, gifted me youthfulness and fervor that I will bring to my everyday tasks. 

Of course, my relationship with my family is rocky. We have differences in priorities and future goals. However, I recognize so earnestly the value of the unconditional love my family gives me everyday. I will cherish them despite the arguments because I know we share the same end goal, but believing in different paths of getting there.

2023-01-27 11:36:21.954,R,,Business,Freshman,Asian,Both,"Throughout my time in high school, I loved making an impact in my local community.  I was involved in a variety of programs to give back, including tutoring the youth's, coaching little league baseball kids, and creating hand-made masks for my local hospital. Furthermore, through courses like economics and accounting, I realized that business was the major for me. Specifically, I became interested in analyzing companies, industries, and the overall market. Through EIIG, I will have the opportunity to combine two of my biggest passions: business and giving back. Small businesses are in need of financing, as many of them fail within their first years. Financing these organizations and providing them consulting aid can push their businesses off the ground and towards success. Providing micro loans is a great way to not only make money from investments, but also help the small businesses in our community grow. I love how EIIG focuses on both profitability and helping out our community. For that reason, I would love to be a member of EIIG's team. ","Throughout my life, I have always made the extra effort to give back to the people. In high school, I tutored underprivileged students for free to help them with their classes. During COVID, I taught a first grader named Caleb through the program Learn in Shelter. On the first day, Caleb's mother told me he was struggling in school, and she wanted me to help him in Math and Spanish. I then set up a schedule for us to meet twice a week for the next two months. One day each week would be for Math, the other for Spanish. During this time, I would help him learn core concepts of both subjects using interactive presentations and fun online games. In no time, we saw progress. From not knowing how to do double digit addition to learning how to multiply, I loved seeing Caleb's progression throughout the weeks. Regarding Spanish, he knew nothing prior to our Zoom calls. However, within a couple months, he was able to formulate basic sentences, learn a few verbs, and even properly conjugate them to make them grammatically correct. I was so glad to see the progress Caleb has made, and it warms my heart that I was able to make such an impact in his life. ","When I was a senior, I was the president of the Future Business Leaders of America (FBLA) club. Fresh off of the COVID year, membership for FBLA was much lower than anticipated. This was a significant issue because the teacher was not willing to monitor the club if these low turnout rates (around 5 people) kept happening. To come up with a solution, I first had to figure out the issue. Through talking with many kids, I realized that parents did not want their children to partake in after school activities due to the extra COVID risks. People were interested in the club, but they didn't want to take the risk of getting sick. For that reason, I decided to make the club fully virtual. That way, everybody can have access to the club from the comfort of their own homes, COVID free. This solution turned out way better than I could have imagined. After turning virtual, the club consistently held 20 members on the Zoom each week, doubling the membership from pre-COVID levels. Turning FBLA virtual for the year revived the club and was the best decision I made.","The Indian-American community has dramatically shaped my identity throughout my life. Our local Indian Association Of Somerset County (IAOSC), led by Indian families who have a common goal to preserve and teach the Indian culture in America, was an essential part of my childhood identity. I learned a lot about Indian culture and the many holidays with a common theme: good overcoming evil and love over hate. I celebrated holidays like Diwali (the festival of lights) and Holi (the festival of color) with many of my friends from the Association. I also participated in skits and dances every year, bringing traditions to life through theatrical props, colorful outfits, and performances. In addition, IAOSC was a judgment-free environment, where I saw children and families like mine: wearing similar clothes, dancing to the same music, and eating the same food. As a result, children born and raised in the United States could relate to one another and feel at home when gathering. Overall, the Indian-American community has brought a sense of culture into my life, a core reason why is shaped my identity.

My dad is from South Africa, and I have visited numerous times. I have always been struck by the marked disparities between the rich, predominantly white, and poor, predominantly black populations. Through my volunteer work with Love to Langa, I have organized several fundraisers to build a swimming academy in Langa Township, where childhood drowning is a common cause of death among children under ten. Bridging the lack of opportunity gap and hearing stories from parents of children in the township was deeply rewarding.

Although volunteering for Love to Langa taught me a lot, I am under no illusion that I still have a lot to learn. I am eager to be involved in different stages of EIIG’s process, from sourcing to consulting. Interacting with entrepreneurs and helping improve inefficiencies within their businesses excites me. Most importantly, seeing the trajectory of their growth means that I made a tangible impact. 

Lastly, I want to join EIIG because I value being in an intimate environment where my perspectives are heard, preconceptions are challenged, and ideas are energized. Also, from speaking with EIIG members at the Coffee and Bagel Chat, I felt a contagious passion for their work and genuine sense of camaraderie, which I haven't felt from other organizations on campus. Ultimately, I envision myself being part of something greater than myself.","In high school, I wrote an economics research paper guided by Professor Robert Harris.

I was the only high school student who had ever reached out to him directly and was nothing like his typical post doctoral students. Perhaps there is something to be said for a youthful lack of intimidation and for an intrinsic belief that no barrier is too high to climb.

In a way, the content of my research paper is immaterial. No, it wasn’t based in complex mathematics or esoteric statistics. No, I am not a seventeen-year-old mathematics savant. On the contrary, it was borne out of my personal belief that the smartest people are those who can make complex topics understandable. So Professor Harris’s suggestion to research Special Purpose Acquisition Companies was an opportunity for me to do just that: to make the complex simple and to communicate it in an effective manner. At completion, I didn’t just have a paper to turn in; I had a dialogue to share.

What I hope to learn at EIIG, and bring to EIIG, is a willingness to create opportunities when there seem to be none, and to be curious, creative and generous in learning. Most importantly, I hope to share my passions with my fellow students and, one day, with the world - not by being a praised and aloof savant (who doesn’t respond to desperate high schooler emails), but by being someone who cares enough to make complex topics understandable, approachable, and accessible. ","After surveying my classmates about their sleeping habits, it became apparent that sleep deprivation was a prevalent issue at my high school. Changing school start times could solve this problem, but it was a logistical challenge. As a student representative selected by my teachers, I collaborated with committee members to brainstorm novel solutions. I proposed ideas such as reducing the time between classes, reversing the high school start time with the elementary school start time, and taking into account traffic delays caused by the recent construction of a hospital near the high school. But even more so than the ideas themselves, giving a persuasive speech to the school board highlighting the importance of addressing sleep deprivation was most effective. Students are at the forefront of this issue, and with student representation, school board members could fully understand and address the perspectives and experiences of students.","The tennis community is an integral aspect of my identity. I have played tennis my entire life and have made amazing friends through the sport. But my most meaningful experiences have come from coaching. I coached tennis for Aceing for Autism and was assigned, Josh. His mom and I spent hours feeding him balls. One swing and miss after another led to frustration, but eventually to that golden moment when the ball whizzed over the net. I still recall Josh’s smile, his mom’s tears, and the lump in my throat as I understood the significance of that seemingly insignificant moment for a young boy who had persevered. It was a lesson for the teacher more than the student. Like Josh, I have had to throw myself at a task over and over again before throwing in the towel. Perhaps, the most rewarding swings really do come from many misses. ",,3.8,0.548,0.326,

In India, where my family is from, the stark disparity of wealth seemed paradoxical. Witnessing the coexistence of affluence and wide-spread abject poverty led me to reflect on how financial stability could influence life trajectories. I started working with a non-profit organization, Setu (www.setuworld.org). My intersecting identities across vastly different geographies, US and India, combined with a view of economic trends through an Investment banking lens of my father led me to develop a passion for finance and community service. 

As Emory is expanding its commitment to social innovation, I intend to use this platform to engage in experiential learning opportunities. The Emory Impact Investment Club will give me ample opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and more importantly provide me training and experience of research and investing. I firmly believe that the market economy can provide innovative profitable solutions to economic inequities. Along with its objective of delivering commercial returns, EIIG provides financial opportunities, creates livelihoods, reduces vulnerabilities through its investments in ambitious entrepreneurs in Atlanta.

My career goal is to work in multilateral agencies like IMF, World Bank, Socially Responsible Fund, and eventually start a Global Impact Fund. The rigor and quality of projects at EIIG will provide a rock-solid foundation for success in career and life. 
","Living on the fringes of big cities in India, migrants face an utter lack of civic amenities. The pandemic further exacerbated their already fragile livelihoods, with millions slipping into chronic hunger and hopelessness. In response, I helped mobilize Setu, an NGO that I am closely associated with, to provide over two million meals in these communities, perhaps our largest initiative thus far. 
I helped start a crowdfunding exercise and was able to raise money to initiate meal delivery in the communities. The Setu fundraiser post on Facebook drew a lot of attention and soon support started flowing in. I asked project managers to collect statistics on the number of households, cost of basic supplies etc., and continued to report back the metrics to our donors.
No matter how hard the Government tries to provide fiscal support, crisis management is difficult simply because of the sheer population, lack of literacy, cluster living conditions and lack of right information.
 
In such a scenario it is imperative for the community to be in lockstep with the government and have strategic engagement at the grassroots level. Witnessing the success of Setu and other community leaders, I am now convinced that NGOs can play a pivotal role in creating alternative narratives of effective governance and influence policy makers to address health and social needs of marginalized communities. Empowering NGOs and communities through right governance and training excites me.
","During the pandemic, the midday meals children from poor households received were disrupted. I had initially planned to go to India that summer and help out. However, since I couldn't do that, I started a teen chapter to mobilize teenagers I knew locally in the US and through my contacts in India to spread the message and acquire donations for the mid-day meal foundation there. Through this, we started a Children in Poverty alliance chapter at my school that brought together people skilled in programming and general social issues. I assembled an entire team of like-minded students during a global pandemic. We conducted calls with local coordinators to assess the progress and created a website and fundraising campaigns. I also ended up being featured in a newspaper back there. I worked within my constraints and leveraged my network and knowledge to assemble a successful plan."," The most defining moment was when I suffered a  misdiagnosed injury that caused a complicated rehabilitation process. This experience was difficult and painful. I developed severe anxiety and became extremely introverted as a result.

However, I decided to turn this weakness into a strength. I moved to a different place in high school and decided to make the most of this new and unfamiliar environment. I forced myself to interact with the people around me and put myself out there, even though it was scary and uncomfortable. Through these interactions, I developed the courage to be involved in MUN, something that had a strong correlation with my weakness. I eventually became a leader in the club  and gained valuable perspective and life experiences.

The perspective I gained during this period taught me about persevearance. I learned to look at obstacles and challenges as opportunities to build strength and character. This attitude has helped me become a more resilient person. Our identity is a sum total of our experiences, and I am excited to see how my identity will evolve as I gain new experience through the club.",,3.75,0.542,0.335,
2023-01-27 12:03:00.051,R,,Pre-BBA; Double Major: Computer Science,Freshman,Asian,Analyst,"Prior to my interest in consulting, I have always been fascinated with entrepreneurship. Throughout my time in high school, I was always tinkering on some amateur, entrepreneurial endeavor, and through these endeavors, I was fortunate enough to meet a mentor who not only educated me about entrepreneurship, but offered direct guidance and support to overcome any business challenge that arose. Retrospectively, I realized the act my mentor was engaging in was called startup consulting, and to see his ability to approach any obstacle that could occur in a startup’s life and strategize a solution was inspiring. Soon after, my interest in entrepreneurship shifted to consulting, and I believe Emory Impact Investment Group would be the ideal organization to guide me towards my aspiration to become a startup consultant for budding, small-business entrepreneurs.

This combined with EIIG’s commitment to social impact through issuing short-term debt investments to close the micro-business gap, makes it everything that I am searching for in a consulting education. As a small business owner myself with entrepreneurial curiosity from rural South Carolina, where local business resources are underserved, I can resonate with EIIG’s mission, as well as provide a deeper understanding behind the work that it does. I am confident that EIIG offers everything I need to develop intellectually, personally, and professionally, and I am beyond excited at the prospect of joining an impactful organization that supports each other like no other.","When the coronavirus had just begun to infiltrate South Carolina, it incited, as lack of information often incites, fear and anxiety within my community. From neighbors to fellow classmates, everyone was intimidated by the mystery of the coronavirus, and sought to become more educated. Common inquiries included “where do I get tested?”, “how do I prevent spread?”, and “how can I support my city in its fight against the pandemic?”. In response to these concerns and recognizing the importance of information in being proactive, a friend and I created CovidSafetyPost, which we intended to serve as a resource and information bulletin specific to our city. The website featured local news articles regarding the pandemic, local testing locations, local statistics updated daily, a self-assessment, prevention tips, and local and nationwide relief organizations that viewers could support. In hopes of reaching as many city residents as we could, we shared our site through social media, and with the help of friends, the social media reposts soon snowballed. Through this experience, I was able to reflect and come up with a definition for success: helping just one more person and solving just one more problem for the betterment of society. My partner and I like to believe that our site contributed to educating at least one more community member, and that to us gave more than enough meaning behind our work.  ","During high school, I was an involved member of its academic team, through which my teammates and I would compete in trivia-style quiz bowls in various academic areas with other teams in the region. At my first academic quiz tournament, I realized that the scorekeeping process was a disaster. Despite living in the digital age, scores were kept using pencil and paper, creating much room for human error. When scores were released, mass disputes ensued, as everyone who claimed to have kept score arrived at a different number. 

Later that day, I immediately started developing NAQTracker (https://github.com/hparkelsey/NAQTracker), a 9,600-line JavaScript web application that digitizes the scorekeeping process of National Academic Quiz Tournament rounds to minimize human error, improve tournament efficiency, and guide users to more easily keep score. Through implementing my program, scores became more accurate and consistent, and the overall quiz experience became smoother.","I have always identified myself to be an entrepreneur, and thus, an avid enthusiast of the startup community. During my first semester, I participated in The Hatchery’s Hobby to Hustle startup accelerator and pitch competition. Through this experience, I was not only able to connect with Emory’s community of innovators, but also local entrepreneurs in Atlanta.

Unfortunately, after my first semester, I was forced into taking a gap year for physical health reasons. Despite being preoccupied with medical treatment, I could not contain my longing to engage with the startup community. With the little downtime I had, I interviewed founders of interesting new Y-Combinator-backed startups, one of whom I had the pleasure of creating ads for, who were gracious enough to share their wisdom with me. The futuristic drive of the startup community inspires me, and I hope to continue to build genuine relationships with local entrepreneurs through EIIG.",,3.75,0.541,0.33,
2023-01-27 12:51:19.913,R,,BBA,Freshman,,Analyst,"EIIG’s mission statement of aiming to close the micro-business gap in high poverty areas by supporting small businesses through short term debt investments to entrepreneurs is something that deeply resonates with me. As a young entrepreneur, I have a great understanding of the necessity of financial support and guidance when starting/growing a small business. Whether it is managing my growing staff of boat cleaners to raising capital for Gustbuster umbrellas, I have gained the skills and knowledge to run a successful business from the ground up. I believe that these skills and knowledge base that I have developed could directly benefit the members of EIIG. I know how to find the financial opportunities, but am eager to learn how to support small businesses in the investment landscape. Additionally, EIIG would allow me to get a first person view of the impact of Fintech and M&A on the success of small businesses. small business One of the main reasons why I chose to come to Emory is to explore the culture and develop relationships with the people of Atlanta, and I feel that there is no better way to do so than through the lens of EIIG. EIIG would allow me to combine my curiosity about investment with a deep desire to help the small businesses in Atlanta. EIIG is more than an investment group. It's a family of like-minded people who want to help each other grow and learn in the finance world.","Ever since I began boating with my dad, one of my core memories has been our ritual called boat cleaning Mondays. On Mondays during the boating season, my dad and I would go down to the marina and spend two to three hours cleaning the boat. At first, I remember dreading boat cleaning Mondays. However, as I got older, I gained more experience and began cleaning the boat on my own. Those boat cleaning mondays soon turned into Layne’s Boat Cleaning. In the summer of 2020, I started my boat cleaning business with only $50. I spent $16 on flyers that I printed out and designed at Staples and the rest on cleaning supplies. But cleaning boats didn’t feel like “work”. There was something cathartic about it. I would put in my headphones, enjoy the scenery, and truly have a good time. I was also passionate about what I was doing. I took great pride in doing my best work in order to keep my clients happy. That passion and determination has aided my journey in scaling Layne’s Boat Cleaning. Today, Layne’s Boat Cleaning has over 50+ clients at multiple marinas and I have a staff of seasonal cleaners. While I never imagined boat cleaning Mondays to turn into a successful business, I have been able to get a first-person view of the success that comes from passion. When someone is passionate about something, they will do their best work. Who knew that there was passion behind cleaning boats.","November 24th, 2021, is a day that I will always remember. On this day, I was handed a daunting challenge that has since turned into an unforgettable opportunity. When I took over Gustbuster umbrellas, I was taking over a company that had only one thing going for it — a good product. Gustbuster is a high-end umbrella company that had been run by two complacent gentlemen for the past twenty years. When I stepped in, the company had no website, no marketing, and was still using pen and paper to track inventory. However, with no real business experience and only $2000 of capital to spend, I was able to create an online storefront, hire a photographer from my town’s local facebook group, create instagram and facebook ad campaigns, and develop email marketing campaigns using a platform called Klaviyo. And, one year later, Gustbuster surpassed over $100,000 in online sales revenue.","The marina community at Compo Marina in Westport, CT has shaped part of my identity. As a kid, I vividly remember spending my summers down at the marina boating with my dad. Not only do I remember the fun days out on the water, but I also remember all of our boat neighbors and the relationships that we made with them. When I turned 16, my relationships with my marina peers progressed as I got a job as a dock attendant. I spent even more time on the docks bonding with those around me. Ultimately, I credit my time at the marina for helping me develop my social skills and personal values. To some, Compo marina represents a place for boats to dock, but for me, it represents a community that has given me some of my best friends, role models, amazing memories, and knowledge that will last a lifetime.

In order to progress with this goal, I joined Circle K, an Emory club with a focus on community service, and Social Impact 360 (SI360), a club which helps nonprofits in the Atlanta area through consulting. When I reached out to non-profit owners in Atlanta for SI360 and saw their passion for their company and improving the community, I became certain that this is an area I’d like to continue working in. I learned by talking to some of the business owners how difficult their journey has been and how it’s taken years of hard work often because of insufficient resources, which limited their possible impact on their community. The microloans that EIIG gives to small businesses was one of the primary factors which first attracted me towards it because the loans significantly increase the impact the club can have on the businesses. Apart from this the member’s genuine interest in the clients and going to events like Carrot Dog visit, Emory’s tradeshow, etc further cemented my interest. Another quality of EIIG I admire is the members’ enthusiasm for not just the clients but also the club and its tight knit community. EIIG’s mission greatly aligns with personal goals of improving my community and believe that I would make a great addition because of my passion for helping the community and past experiences in it. ","When I was in high school in Venezuela, I learned about a great injustice: while the international teachers received a high salary, the local staff made less than 100 dollars a month. I knew that making an administrative change regarding the salary would be very difficult, so I decided that I wanted to help them in any way I can within my capacity. This is the primary reason that I decided to join the National Honors Society (NHS) when invited. Throughout my time in the organization we planned several events like the food drive, clothes drive, and other charity events. Since the school only had few students due to the political conditions of the country, the club didn’t have a strict structure and anyone could volunteer on taking on the role they desired. Some of my roles included making the posters, helping sort out clothes, writing emails to remind students about the drive, handing out all the collected items, etc. It was very rewarding to know that we were helping people who were genuinely in need of the things that we were gathering through donations from the students and teachers. The gratitude of the staff was apparent from their reaction to the events, and that showed that our actions made a genuine difference. This organization was one of the more rewarding I have participated in because I could see the difference which was being made from my effort and knew that I was helping those who needed it.","As a CS double major, when I saw the opportunity of being in charge of Emory’s Astronomy website, I jumped at it. Though I’ve made a few websites myself, I didn’t have experience with publishing them online or using GitHub, which forced me to think creatively by having to learn about an application while editing it and using my deduction skills to learn how to apply the new information to the website and modify it to perform my desired function. This was demonstrated through my first task of updating the website using HTML and GitHub’s version of CSS. I had to navigate through the directory to find a file with thousands of lines of code to make the necessary changes. Another challenge was working with a DNS server for the first time to get the website back online. I thoroughly enjoyed using creativity and problem solving to learn new skills. ","I’ve lived in 6 different countries throughout my life: Italy, Russia, India, Mexico, Venezuela, and now the US. All of these countries with unique culture, people, and communities have ingrained a part of themselves inside my personality and have felt like home. When I first went to an international school in 5th grade in Mexico, I was delighted to discover others who also call more than one place their home began to feel accepted in the small community of my school. I was exposed to not only Mexican culture, but that of so many more countries through my friends. From moving to Venezuela I realized one culture, Latin American, can have so many facets depending on the country. Both the Latin American and the community I’ve found at international school has made me more aware of different cultures and has made me both curious and enthusiastic about learning about them.

I realized that as an investing club, EIIG not only provides loans to entrepreneurs but also creates a strong relationship with them. The members ensure that the entrepreneur not only grows financially but also makes a sustainable impact on their community or the world. Furthermore, by ensuring that the entrepreneur creates social impact, EIIG analysts can make their own impact on the world. I believe this to be my main reason to join EIIG. 
As a part of EIIG, I wish to make an impact on local entrepreneurs, and I hope to help them reduce their challenges by providing creative and cost-effective solutions to their problems. I hope to build great efficacies and best practices for the entrepreneurs I assist. My interest in accounting and finance will ensure I promptly learn the processes involved in providing micro-loans to businesses and my ability to listen well and effortlessly look at different perspectives will ensure that I provide unbiased ideas and consultations to entrepreneurs from different backgrounds. Therefore, I hope to join EIIG to not only help as many entrepreneurs as possible but to also eagerly learn in the process.","I was on the beach in Alibag when I found an emaciated dog. I decided to follow my instincts and feed him immediately. The nick on his ear conveyed he had been vaccinated; I approached cautiously. I pulled out a packet of biscuits, left them on the ground and waited as the mutt slowly inched closer and gormandized the food. I ended up giving him a lot more, after which he happily followed me around. 
       This is a recurring theme in my life. Every time I see a stray, I first judge whether it’s safe. Then, I will approach it, feed it, and play with it. I even associate places with the strays I know there. When I see a stray, I do not see a scary, unhygienic being. Instead, I see an affectionate, playful animal that needs some compassion. 
       Feeding animals not only satisfies their hunger but also feeds my soul. Therefore, by volunteering at Welfare of Stray Dog’s kennel, I learnt the basics of animal rescue and aid and began doing so independently with animals in and around my city. I ensured that they were fed and medically taken care of. During the onset of the COVID lockdown, I convinced a number of people, including a few family members to aid my idea of feeding as many stray animals as I can in my area, all while following the restrictions the government had placed. I truly wish to help the strays and around the world that require nourishment and affection and therefore, make an impact to improve animal welfare.
","       As a part of my Marketing project, my group was given the responsibility to modify a product to re-introduce an improved version of it to the market. I came up with the microwaveable pillow made of flaxseeds and an organic cotton covering which comes in an array of different colors. This makes the product extremely sustainable and economical because cotton and flaxseed are relatively inexpensive raw materials. 	
       The purpose of this idea is to support my belief in providing inexpensive and soothing period commodities to women on their periods. Many women in the world not only don’t have access to sanitary products for their menstrual cycle, but also don’t have access to commodities that help reduce the pain. Therefore, as a part of the sale this product, my team and I decided to donate one pillow for every 5 pillows to support access to reproductive health in low-income communities.","Growing up, my parents sent me to some “religious classes” on Hinduism and God that I thought would happen to be an unnecessary addition to my life. However, as I grew older and I attended their classes for pre-teens, I started understanding different ways to perceive stories that were written in religious books which made me look at religion through a unique perspective. Through these classes, I understood that the laws of religion are a choice that people should be allowed to make. I also learnt the art of looking at different perspectives and thinking holistically through these classes. I believe that the students and teachers in my class really made a positive impact on shaping my views and opinions, especially because I got the opportunity to listen to multiple different opinions and ideas during my time there and these thoughts and ideas truly shaped who I am now.

Impact investing is an emerging and rapidly growing asset class that combines financial returns with social and environmental impact. I want to investigate and learn more about this fascinating field. I consider impact investing as a potent tool for bringing about long-lasting social change, and I'm thrilled to have the chance to contribute to its growth.

I believe that I can contribute to the club through my knowledge of economics and business. I am familiar with both more complicated subjects like macroeconomics and international finance as well as fundamental topics like financial statements and budgeting. Additionally, I have a thorough understanding of macroeconomic policies and how they affect investments and enterprises. My understanding of economics and business will help me to make wise investment decisions and to better comprehend the field of impact investing.

In addition to my passion for impact investing, I am also excited about the potential for collaboration and networking opportunities that EIIG provides. I am looking forward to learning from experienced professionals who are already working in this field, building relationships with like-minded individuals who are dedicated to having a good social impact, and working on projects that drive meaningful change. I am confident that I will be able to contribute valuable skills and perspectives to the group, and I am excited to be part of this innovative and important work. ","Ahimsa is the Jain principle to not waste, overuse, abuse, or pollute.

Growing up on this principle in a business family of Kolkata has driven me towards sustainable business practices. Through my internship at fashion-wear brand, House of Dreams, and work in my school’s Nature Club, I understood the various unsustainable practices in the fashion industry and vowed to make efforts to change them. This motivated me to launch ‘The Ethical Sphere’ to encourage people to dress well sustainably. 

As part of the project, I initiated various awareness campaigns, including an event ‘SustaFash’, where I also shared details about fashion brands using new eco-friendly methods to create great looks. Additionally, I organized a donation drive where I collected 2500 pieces of clothes to be distributed to the needy. During the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown that followed, I connected tailors to consumers for altering clothes, encouraging re-use of clothes and employment for tailors who were practically out of work and unable to sustain themselves.

It is my desire and hope that in the times to come I will be able to take the good work forward. My work has received much appreciation, including from the Home Secretary of my state, West Bengal, making my efforts worthwhile. The response encouraged me to remain dedicated to the cause of finding solutions related to non-sustainable methods. I have worked like a passionate entrepreneur honing organizational, communication, and finance skills. I now seek to continue growing into a sustainably responsible businessman.","Mind-mapping is a visual representation of ideas and concepts, with the main ideas placed in the center and related concepts radiating outwards. Similar visual representations of ideas are used in concept mapping, although the emphasis is more on the links between concepts than on the individual ideas themselves.

I used a mind-map for a project I was working on to create a more effective methodology. I started by writing down the main tasks and then adding related tasks and activities that needed to be completed. This enabled me to easily visualize the entire process, identify areas for improvement, and develop a more efficient workflow.

I created a concept map to help me comprehend customer segmentation better. I began by outlining the numerous client segments, followed by the many traits that characterized each section. This made it simple for me to comprehend the various market segments and create meaningful strategies to target each one.","My family is a community that has shaped a large part of my identity. Growing up, I was surrounded by a wide variety of people and experiences that gave me a unique perspective on the business world. I have learned the importance of hard work and dedication. Being surrounded by strong and supportive family members has also taught me the importance of resilience and perseverance, even in the face of adversity. These values have been integral to my development and have shaped my work ethic, and my moral compass.

I also had the opportunity to observe my family members in different business and entrepreneurial roles, making me realize the importance of having strong leadership qualities, and effective communication skills.

I admire how the club not only provides capital to small business that would not typically have access, but also consults and aids them throughout the loan process in order to use the money in meaningful ways. It would be very easy as a group to provide a loan and expect the business to pay it back by a given date without any help, which as a practice is inherently hostile and can in fact burden a business more than assist it. So, I appreciate the efforts and mission of EIIG to be in constant communication and assistance to the businesses that it as a group provides to, and I believe it is vastly important to the success and economic development of the small businesses in the Atlanta community. I would love to be a part of this process providing financial opportunity for those who seek it, especially within underrepresented and disadvantaged groups and nationalities. I, myself, am from the Metro Atlanta area so I would be excited and proud to make impactful strides toward facilitating economic growth in a community which I have been a part of my whole life.","In high school I was fortunate to be a part of the Warrior Wishes Project as a member of my school's Spanish Honors Society program. This was a fundraiser and project in which as a club we raised money to by gifts for children at a local elementary school who were less fortunate financially. The project culminated with me along with other members going out with the elementary students and shopping with them, helping them pick out toys and games, along with other necessary items that they otherwise may not have been able to obtain. This project resonated with me as I was able to see first hand the impact that the fundraiser made as I watched each kid pick out their gift. We had worked with most of the children through the year already and I saw the struggles that the children went through: some kids were without school supplies, many children without basic items such as winter clothes. So, to not only see the children get excited for new toy, but to also know that the they would have their necessities was a moving experience. ","My senior year of high school I would constantly hear in school about adults going to board meetings speaking to the school board of my county about how they wished certain books would be taken off the shelves due to unbased claims of indoctrination. Many parents and fellow students were concerned with the influence that this small group of people may have on the board and, in turn, our education. So, being an avid reader and one who is passionate about the necessity of books with various perspectives, I went to a school board meeting and signed up to speak in front of the board. Over the course of a couple weeks, I had carefully crafted a speech in which I outlined the flaws and problematic nature in the criticisms of certain books that were being brought in front of the board, while also relaying the danger of banning books within the classroom.","Growing up being a part of the Hispanic community has not only had a large part on my view of the world, but it has shaped my understanding of determination. As a member of the Hispanic community, I understand what it is like to be a part of an underrepresented group that far too often is marginalized and looked down upon in certain context. Understanding and experiences that aspect of life first hand has motivated me and molded my values in order to show of which I, along with all individuals within my community, are capable.

Back in New York, many of my uncles owned their own corner stores, despite coming to this country from the Dominican Republic with no money in their pockets. They began as baggers, then cashiers, and eventually saved up enough money to run their own stores, despite their broken English and lack of financial literacy. They all supported one another and once their children learned the language they relied on them as well. My mom’s brother, Tio Jose Luis, started a chain of Dominican restaurants where I worked for three years during high school. Honestly, these men inspired me and I feel like I owe it to them to pay it forward. At EIIG, I hope to find people in similar situations, specifically immigrants and refugees, who simply need a guiding hand in understanding how to navigate such a difficult market. I know my family members wish they had an organization like EIIG to support them when they first stepped their foot in the door, and in a huge city like Atlanta I know there will be a number of opportunities for my personal commitment to help many local businesses shine. ","In 2020, America had a racial reckoning like it’s never seen before. Some friends and I took initiative and revitalized an old Regis club, Black Student Union. Since then, BSU has taken remarkable leaps and bounds to raise awareness about racial injustice at Regis and the nation as a whole. This past year BSU undertook a project to promote intergenerational dialogue surrounding the state of race at Regis. The purpose of the project was to conduct interviews with faculty and staff to gather information and provide opportunities for discussion between students and faculty. With a committed team, we were able to conduct over 50 hour-long interviews. I was dedicated to conducting as many interviews as possible so that I could understand the people who play a pivotal role in shaping the minds of the students at my school. Connecting with the faculty through this initiative opens the door for diversifying an education system that has been heavily whitewashed since the school’s founding.
In terms of what this project meant to me, getting to hear from teachers who I did not think had much to say about racism at the school they worked at was certainly eye-opening. Despite the fact that I myself am not black (I am a racially white Latino), I felt really connected to BSU’s mission, as we were addressing issues that have been building up in our school community for years. All in all, I enjoyed being part of this team and felt that I was legitimately making a difference.
","In the time that I have worked at the Latin American Association, the organization has seen its fair share of issues (not caused by me, thankfully). It has mainly been my responsibility to digitize a lot of the LAA’s functions, helping them move a little more into the 21st century. I revamped and assisted in standardizing their phone system, recommended better means of communications in place of emails, but the contribution that I am proudest of is revitalizing the system to register immigrant students for English classes. The online option has been available for a while, but students had difficulty doing this, and I was the one who suggested we make an in-person option at reception. If students choose to register in person, they get a much more personalized experience and could figure out the lay of things, as opposed to not knowing where anything is and being nervous on their first day of classes.
","I touched on it alot in the answer to my first question, but the community I feel has shaped me the most is my Dominican family. I would not be where I am today without many of the traits I inherited from these people. I learned to put myself out there without fear of judgement because when one is from a large family, you really have no choice. As I mentioned before, my family banded together to help each other out, lending out money with no interest because somebody needed it. Due to this, I feel both charitable and a sense of unity, as I am the “I got you” friend until the end of my days. For this reason, I consider myself a team player, whereas if I did not grow up this way, I would definitely be more self-prioritized.

While I do not have much experience in analyzing businesses and consulting outside of my formal education, gaining exposure to the impact investment world will make me a more insightful person. Although I have a lot to learn financially I have always appreciated volunteerism, and enjoy being able to help the community get access to basic needs. I am aware that service is a great way of reaching out; however, it is a band-aid solution to greater injustice.

However, for the past couple of years, I’ve tried to implement this time to pursue something meaningful: helping at the food pantry. Initially, I had my reservations after being nagged by my insistent mother, but I instantly fell in love with the place. My Saturday mornings soon became dedicated to serving families at the food pantry. Something about the whole experience kept me hooked. Nothing is more rewarding than seeing the happiness in my patrons' eyes when I come out with bags filled with food, knowing that they can support their families. Aside from my impact on these families, they were just as impactful to me. I used to be timid, but meeting several families weekly allowed me to come out of my shell and create relationships with these wonderful people. One unexpected impact, however, was the opportunity to practice my foreign language speaking abilities. A lot of the families that would come to the food pantry have recently immigrated to the US and aren’t completely familiar with English, creating a language barrier. While I never expected to use my French outside of the classroom, the food pantry allowed me to bridge the language gap. Although my French skills are far from perfect, these families knew that they could count on me to be heard.","In the fast food industry, time is very important. As a worker at a burger joint, my manager always expected us to roll out food as quickly and efficiently as possible. Before opening the doors to customers, we would spend hours preparing the food we would sell later in the day. One of the biggest tasks for the whole joint was cutting and cleaning the potatoes. By far the most time-consuming and labor-intensive part of our meal prep, the potatoes alone took up a whole two hours. I developed a more efficient way of cleaning the potatoes, consolidating the drawn-out process into a quick assembly line method that allowed the potatoes to get cleaned and then immediately cut. It cut our prep time in half, so my manager implemented and standardized the process.","In 1999, my parents decided to immigrate to the United States from Colombia.

Aside from participating in all the fun traditions, my parents would always tell us stories about their life in Colombia. It goes without saying that their lives were difficult, but my parents always had a positive outlook that I appreciated. Despite going through economic trouble, Colombians are reported to be one of the happiest people.

I am just beginning to explore the business field, and I want my first input to be with the EIIG team and become a truly impactful contribution. ","Before the pandemic, I embarked on a series of service trips to Kathmandu, Nepal. I first arrived in the summer of 2019 and served as an English teacher to primary school children in a rural village five hours from Kathmandu. One day, a girl in my class received her period. Instead of a pad or tampon, she pulled out a palm-sized cushion with cotton balls taped on it. When I visited the only convenience store that afternoon, not a single shelf had any feminine products amongst the ten rows of supplies. In rural villages of Nepal, menstruation is considered an impurity, causing the lack of access to feminine products. I returned in the winter of 2019 to film a short documentary with a team of students. Our documentary featured several Nepali girls narrating their stories: revealing their unfamiliarity towards menstruation and shame towards this natural cycle. After playing this documentary in my high school and a few others around the area, we were able to raise enough money to secure a stable supply of feminine products in the convenience store of that village. Experiencing shame and embarrassment about menstruation is an extremely common and natural sentiment amongst young women, and it is extremely important for young girls to receive support and education when they first begin menstruation. Though we did not secure every Nepali store a stable supply of menstruation products, there is at least one less girl who needs to use the cushion with cotton balls. ","Last spring, I discovered an Instagram post about how flowery squiggles would replace traditional Chinese patterns for a “modern mahjong makeover.” This incident motivated me to lead a workshop on the whitewashing of Asian culture at the Asian American Footstep Conference (AAFC). During the first session of the workshop, however, few students shared their personal experiences of microaggression. After the first session, I scrolled through social media accounts related to Asian injustices and discovered that many Asian students shared the sentiment that the microaggression they have experienced is not “serious” enough to be brought to attention. I tackled this problem in the remaining sessions by creating a series of hypothetical situations and asking the participants if this was an example of racism. As we worked through various scenarios, participants agreed that these “trivial” acts were indeed unacceptable, and they have in fact experienced similar situations themselves. The series of hypotheticals successfully guided my workshop into an engaging discussion.  ","A community that has shaped a significant part of my identity is my high school: Groton school. In the past four years, I have spent numerous twenty-four hours studying, eating, and sleeping in that historical place. Before Groton, I never had an opinion or strong belief. I was not too afraid to state what I believed in; I simply was not aware of the world enough to strong like or dislike anything. During an all-school discussion in my first week of freshman year, I witnessed a senior proudly voice out his concern for climate change. He was bold, confident, and unapologetic. It was at Groton, a place filled and defined by individuals like that senior, that I began to observe the details of the world, find people that I want to protect, and fight against concepts I believe are wrong.

I am most invigorated by the opportunity to build relationships with the entrepreneurs. Since the analyst teams work more directly with the entrepreneurs themselves, I will be able to grow and learn alongside the entrepreneurs through the loan process. Having been in EIIG, I understand that the heart of our projects is the connections we build with the entrepreneurs as we help their businesses expand, and I hope to serve a more direct role in establishing these relationships. 
In addition, I am particularly interested in the Due Diligence portion of the 6-step process. My biggest passion within the realm of business is analyzing a businesses’ current financial standpoint and relating that to potential in the future, which is why I feel that Due Diligence along with my background in quantitative subject areas will allow me to thrive as an analyst in this portion of the process. 
Furthermore, I resonate with EIIG’s mission to close the micro-business gap since COVID-19 pandemic caused many micro-businesses in my hometown. Although I am not sure if a microloan would have saved these businesses, I want to be part of teams that utilize microloans to prevent the trend that occurred in my hometown. 
","One activity that I was passionate about was my comedy act in my high school talent show. Choosing to create a comedy act with my cousin was a risky endeavor since all other acts in the talent show were musical acts; however, we were inspired to add more diversity for my final talent show. 
Our act consisted of recreating our 10 favorite pop culture moments from the decade within 3 minutes. We previously had no experience in performing live comedy, so writing and editing a script that was suitable for the show was an arduous process. Many of my peers in my classes openly ridiculed our potential, I remained resolute, practicing and revising almost everyday after school to perfect our craft. The most difficult part of the show was ensuring that every joke was accessible to a wide variety of members in the audience, which included our peers as well as elderly members of the community. 
However, when we performed on stage, we heard a cacophony of laughter each night, signaling our success in connecting with the audience. Even though a high school comedy act may seem frivolous, I added originality to a show with a diverse amount of audience members from the community, showcasing my ability to set a new precedent for artistic expression within my community. 
","During my job as a bagger at the grocery store Marianos, I aided a distressed customer by communicating to her in Spanish. During the transaction, the cashier was frustrated and confused as to why the customer did not react when asking a simple question such as “plastic or paper?” 
Then, she pulled out her phone, which displayed a Spanish keyboard that she was typing as fast as possible, hoping to translate to English. I then whispered to her, “¿Prefieres plástico o papel?” She immediately smiled and leaned over to me, and she explained that she was embarrassed to say she couldn’t speak English since she had been scolded before by service workers for not knowing English. Although I was saddened by this statement, I assured her that there would always be someone ready to help her translate if she ever returned to the store. 
","One community that has shaped my identity has been the LGBTQIA+ community here at Emory. My high school was honestly not as accepting of gay teens, which is why I found it difficult to express myself and contribute as much as I could when collaborating with others as I felt discouraged by my visible differences. However, I have met encouraging and assertive members of the LGBTQIA+ community here at Emory who have all taught me to value my individuality, especially when I am working with others. 
Understanding and learning the accomplishments in activism from some of these individuals has invigorated me and my friend to start developing plans to include panels of out and proud Emory students pursuing a degree in business. Business, in particular, is heavily underrepresented by the LGBTQIA+ community, so I feel a responsibility for invigorating others to not let their sexual orientation or gender identity prevent them from pursuing a degree in Business Administration.

He was so poor in Korea that his family could not afford any food to eat. To pull his family out of poverty, he went to Seoul to earn money at the age of 18. 

Once he had some money in his hand, he opened his own company in a shared office. All he had was a phone and a small room. His business was an automobile repair shop; he would travel across the peninsula to serve his customers. Now, he is affluent enough to send me to a private university in the United States.

Throughout my life, one thing my father has always told me is that he had wished he had a mentor in his life: someone who could have guided him in his entrepreneurship.

The reason why I am appealed to Emory Impact Investment Group (EIIG) is because of such reason. I want to contribute in helping the small businesses in the Atlanta community via EIIG. I want to be able to consult small businesses like Habeeb’s Gourmet Sauces with their pricing, growth, and social media strategy. 

Providing guidance to people who are in need is one of the most significant values for me. Through EIIG, I will not only acquire tangible knowledge and technical skills in providing analytics and feedbacks to the businesses, but will also enable me to assist these businesses in a wonderful team.","A project that I am extremely passionate about is my current student organization—mEmory Studio.

With the increasing importance of social media and publicity, every club on campus holds events that require photography for their publicity purposes. mEmory studio offers these services free of charge to any undergraduate club on campus. 

As a previous film and media major and a former publicity chair for Liberty in North Korea and Emory Chinese Theater Club, I saw the lack of creative community in Emory. In order to create high-quality content, it requires an immense amount of time, equipments, and labor. However, as most students do not have such resources, I thought of gathering creative artists together to serve the clubs’ need—high-quality digital content.

mEmory Studio was created last semester. Although the organizations is new, we acquired an official partnership with Emory University’s Department of Marketing and Communications to cover the student community, from projects like #SeniorSaturday, highlighting Emory seniors, and other school spirit related events. Additionally, we have worked with over 10+ organizations, such as ASO, CUSO, TASA, ISLAB, RISE, and covered over 20+ events in four months.

Through mEmory Studio, I am slowly resolving the lack of on-campus organization’s demand high-quality digital contents. Although I am no longer a film major, this student organization I created allows me to keep my creativity flowing and be in touch with other fellow artists. I am proud to be a founder of an organization that serves the local community.","A personal problem I had after coming back to Emory from the army was finding a new community.

As I abruptly changed my major from film studies to BBA, I wanted to expose myself to a new community. Since I was considering concentrating in finance in the B-school at the time, Research Investment & Securities at Emory caught my eyes.

Because I did not have any knowledge or prior experience in the finance industry, it was challenging for me to stand out in the competitive application pool. Therefore, I approached the application differently; I applied for RISE’s marketing position and appealed to them with my content creation skills. Ultimately, I am now one of their marketing executives.

I was able to cease such opportunity because I took a different approach compared to others. I objectively knew what I was good at and successfully differentiated myself to join the organization. ","Prior to my military experience, I lived in a safe bubble—a safe sheltered place with people that I trust and love. However, after enlisting in February 2020, my perspective of life has changed.

In the army, I experienced many challenges that not many ordinary people encounter. I had opportunities to shoot weapons, throw a grenade, and go into a gas chamber without a mask. In one of the trainings, we were not allowed to brush our teeth for four days or shower for two weeks.

All of these are experiences that I never would have had if I had not enlisted. After overcoming both physical and mental challenges, I am now truly no longer fearful of what is in front of me. The diligence and positive mindset I acquired in the army will only help me progress further in reaching my dreams and goals. ",,3.625,0.517,0.228,

This response to a question asked during the BBA club fair resonated with me. In essence, EIIG is a finance club incentivized to invest not for profit but for the betterment of a business’s local community. As a person passionate about creating socioeconomic change, how could I not be curious!
As EIIG’s representative described the club in further detail, my curiosity grew with admiration and excitement. From what I understand, development is the face of the club. It is EIIG’s primary form of contact with its potential loan applicants and partnerships. My experience as a first-year representative for Emory’s Collegiate Black Christians will help me flourish and contribute to this branch because it relies on creating and maintaining relationships: a skill central to EIIG’s prosperity. The representative also talked about the due diligence branch, which is responsible for understanding a company’s current standing and profitability by analyzing its financial statement. Because of my interest in a career in finance, the technical skills that I could learn in this branch will prove essential later. I am also genuinely interested in learning more about EIIG's consulting branch. Improving a business's operations and impact on its community is a rare art.
In short, joining EIIG means that I can be curious in an environment that makes an impact.","I met Garcia in high school during an out-of-state group visit to an orphanage. The road trip took three hours, which made me in less than the best of moods, but all sense of discomfort faded as the head of the orphanage led us around the cribs and stopped where Garcia lay. She looked so happy and out of place in the glum orphanage that I had to smile. Later, we discovered that Garcia had been born with spina bifida, an illness affecting her spinal cord. Unfortunately, the orphanage could not shoulder the costs of surgery and physiotherapy to aid her mobility.
When I proposed to our group (Saint Vincent de Paul) that we raise money throughout the school term, I was met with overwhelming eagerness and support. Our main goal was to make a sizeable dent in her treatment costs. To pull this off, we had to go all out: give speeches and presentations at Parent-Teacher conferences, sell confectioneries and hand-made ornaments, host games and raffles, reach out to influential school alumni, and create an accompanying crowdfund campaign. It was neither instantaneous nor easy, but it was worth it.
Witnessing the beginning of Garcia's hospital treatments redefined my passion for helping communities and people. Although this project happened two years ago, it is still my proudest achievement because I was able to contribute to the process of making change.","Reading about the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic was one thing but seeing those who lived in the community around my high school lose their livelihood was another. When my school’s outreach committee identified this problem, it tasked autonomous teams with raising money and easing the transition for these people using creativity. My group commenced a mass social media campaign using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to raise awareness and funds. Because of the lockdown, we worked remotely by sending out infographics made with Canva and videos on different platforms. We also sent personalized videos to people in our network who we knew could contribute. After five weeks of intensive fundraising, the total sum from the autonomous teams exceeded our initial goal!","If my identity were a plate of jollof rice, then my experience as a black woman would have to be the rice itself: no matter what else is on the dish, the rice remains an irreplaceable, ubiquitous part that influences everything else.
I believe each black woman has a unique way they experience this identity, and I love mine. To be Black and a woman in America comes with its share of marginalization, similar yet different to other minority groups in America. Nevertheless, knowing that I belong to these two incredible communities consisting of people who continuously break society’s boundaries encourages me to flourish in every situation.
In addition to my identity, I was raised to achieve. I never fail to do just that because I am honest, dedicated, hardworking, passionate, and capable. As 2Pac once said, “that’s just the way it is...it takes skill to be real.”",,3.625,0.515,0.199,

Providing a more hands-on experience, EIIG will allow me to develop my financial skills that I lack with interactive help from mentors who are truly excited about helping passionate, yet new, students like myself while also allowing me to make a true difference for small businesses here in Atlanta. While there are many clubs on campus, EIIG stands out in a major way - impact. No other club at Emory will provide me with the opportunity to analyze and create projections for small businesses with different people but also immerse myself in a process that both teaches me more and gets me excited to learn because of the effect my work will have on people. The expertise and personal help that EIIG provides proves it is a club that is dedicated to teaching prospective students like myself necessary information to succeed, but also how to marvel at the idea of learning more. It’s clear that the leaders of the club are themselves excited and dedicated to teach and see their members succeed, and I am very excited about the idea of joining and working with a driven group of people that I look to follow in their footsteps.","Although aware of global hunger issues, it wasn’t until I got stuck in traffic going to high school that I realized the severity of the problem in my own community. Curious about the cause, I checked the front of the line, and saw free food being handed out. I felt shocked, as I had always imagined my town as a very affluent place. I did some research and learned that nearly 10% of students at my school needed free lunch, and every Monday, families in need of food were offered free meals. I was so blinded by my privilege that I couldn’t even see what people were going through in my own community. After finding this out, I felt both emotions of discomfort for others and embarrassment for myself for being so unaware - I knew it was time to get involved. Through the Sodexo Move For Hunger Organization and Trenton Soup Kitchen, I collected food donations and donated over 450 meals to families in need, wrapped over 1,000 packaged utensils, and was even featured on Sodexo’s social media to speak out about needing change. These efforts exposed me to the enormity of the problem. There is still work to be done to solve hunger and it requires more than just a few donations. Everyone in the community needs to work together to make a real change. For my part, I plan to continue my service to local food banks and try to raise awareness.","Covid played a big role in the culture of my cross country team in high school. Going into my senior year, there was a large disconnect between upperclassmen and underclassmen due to lack of in-person meeting and races/practice restrictions - one that I had never experienced before. As captain and leader of the team, I felt responsible for rekindling the brotherhood and connection that I was once introduced to as a freshman. I created freshman group chats depending on specific interests and worked with fellow seniors to be responsible for different groups. We also had team meet ups outside of practice and came up with ideas for everyone to be together and experience the same bond that I did. I was able to leave as a senior feeling closer than ever with the underclassmen despite a pandemic and carried on the tradition and culture of the team.","Coming into college I was welcomed into a big community of dedicated, hard working, and driven student athletes on the cross country and track and field teams. Running has always been a vital part of my life and part of my identity that has influenced who I am today. Coming into high school, I was immediately introduced to a group that taught me discipline, hard work, and brotherhood, all important values that I still hold myself to today. Now, transitioning into college, the cross country community here holds me to those standards and more. The way I act, my decision making, and my respect for others are all strongly influenced by the mentors I look up to and lessons I’ve learned throughout my time as a runner.

The south has always been considered a low-income community filled with rich Hispanic roots. Though just 20 minutes away, in West Omaha, the streets are maintained with decorations and businesses are almost luxurious. Growing up in the South, there street vendors thrive, and small businesses filled with authentic Hispanic products are around every corner. What is lacking is capital for many of these businesses, mainly because of lack of knowledge and trust in the location.

A club that applied students to gain leadership and career skills. My competition sector was Quick Serve Restaurant Management Series (QSRM), with 4 years of restaurant experience I felt a bit confident. When I went into my first competition, I was truly shocked, I was the only girl with a golden complex. Instantly feeling out of place, this was my first business event, and everyone seemed to belong. Yet I continued, went to all my events and soon the results came out. I placed 5th place in my category. I realized that despite my nervousness, the event felt natural, as if I was meant to pursue the business route. I showed up to the events throughout the year and slowly gained confidence. DECA made me realize my interest in business, especially hospitality and management. Through my time with DECA I also placed an executive position as VP of treasure, with this position I managed the club's funds and allocations. Soon I was also able to recruit more Hispanic students to join DECA by advertising around the school. At my last event, I feel short in my category. Further making me realize that some losses will arise in business but one must be able to reevaluate and continue. Overall being part of DECA helped me gain confidence in the business world but as an individual who is often not represented in the mix.  ","Upon starting my fitness journey about 3 years ago, I started an Instagram account to keep myself accountable and track my progress. I found this account to be very motivating as peers and even strangers showed support. Soon people started asking me for advice and honestly, I wasn’t skilled enough to give knowledge advice. I wanted to help people but knew I needed to learn accurate information to do so.

I had never heard of impact investing before, but having researched it, EIIG is something that I would really like to be a part of. I have long believed that one of the primary factors holding low-income communities back is the lack of small businesses that are centered around the community and its residents. By providing underserved entrepreneurs access to capital and consulting services throughout a 3-year period, EIIG offers the chance to tangibly improve people’s lives and be a real driver for change in historically underprivileged communities. I am really excited about the opportunity to work directly with entrepreneurs in the Atlanta area and provide them with the funds and resources they need to succeed. As a finance major, I have always been really into numbers, so I hope to use my knowledge and abilities to help those who may not be as comfortable with this aspect of business.

","When the war in Ukraine broke out last year, I didn’t know how to feel and never thought there was anything I could do to make a difference. I had never been to the country, but most of my family had grown up there and I had some close relatives that lived in Kyiv. The invasion significantly impacted my father, whose close childhood friends were mobilized and our family relocated. My dad and his best friend began to take action, creating a fundraiser called HelpFreeUkraine to ship medical supplies to their war-torn homeland. Since they weren’t very tech-savvy, I took charge of creating a bare-bones website and donation page. Donations began to slowly flow in, and by the start of summer, they had received nearly $50,000. After I returned back home from school in May, I saw my dad spending entire days and nights on the phone coordinating this effort and the constant stream of packages at our doorstep served as a reminder that this war wasn’t going to stop anytime soon. I decided that while I was at home, I would take a more active role and help with whatever was needed, whether it was sorting and repackaging boxes of medicine in a New Jersey warehouse or flying with my father to Poland to deliver crucial medicine, ambulances and satellite phones to Ukraine. From this experience, I learned that even if a task or goal may seem too large and unachievable, there are always smaller things you can do that can be just as impactful.
","In my freshman year, I joined OxVentures, a business and entrepreneurship club on the Oxford campus. After Covid, the club seemed to have lost its spark and we didn’t do much of anything in my first semester. Seeing this as an opportunity to revive a club that had stalled, my friend and I decided to run as Co-Presidents with a new vision for the club, hoping to tap into Oxford’s entrepreneurial spirit. In our first week in charge, we decided to hold a pitch competition. When I suggested a Shark-Tank style competition, the idea took off. We worked to recruit judges, find a suitable location, and get SGA approval. Within a few weeks, we had scheduled a Shark-Tank style pitch competition with Dean Hicks and several professors as judges, with multiple teams competing and around 100 attendees. This event put our club on the map and we were able to gain closer ties to our parent club, EEVM.","The past two summers I’ve worked as a tennis coach, helping kids develop their tennis abilities while improving my own communication and teaching skills. I’ve been playing tennis since I was about 7 years old, and what I love most about this sport is that it is such a mental game, similar to chess. Raw power and athleticism alone is often not enough to win a match, as to win each point you need to continuously reposition yourself and place your shots until an opportunity arises to attack and finish the point.
For me, tennis serves as an escape from the challenges and stress of daily life, allowing me to fully focus on beating my opponent. It has taught me how to be mentally strong, to never give up, and to take the match(life), one point(thing) at a time.

I consider and get the sense that EIIG is a really tight knit community where I can learn a lot on how to help support and grow smaller businesses and communities. This is important to me w because I am from  South Central Los Angeles, a historically redlined part of the cities that has had long term effects on the economic development of the city, where many of these smaller businesses and communities are not able to flourish due to lack of financial resources. In South Central  LA for example, there are high poverty rates. Homelessness and gentrification continue to grow in the city, with this partly driven by the history of largely marginalized communities being redlined. Loans and other financial tools for example, were not given out to many of those people who are predominantly lower income minorities. It is proven that in California small businesses are drivers of economic growth, creating two thirds of new jobs and employing nearly half of all private sector employees. Given these facts I would want the same for Atlanta because clearly with smaller businesses flourishing the economy flourishes as a whole, so I really feel like joining EIIG would help me help the community around me at Emory and also my community in Los Angeles.","I joined the human rights student task force in high school because I was passionate about making a difference in the world. This club helped me learn more about human rights and how to help people who were affected by them. The club was a great way to learn about human rights and how to advocate for them. I also loved meeting other people who were passionate about human rights and making a difference. We would have lively debates about various human rights issues and it was always enlightening to hear other people's perspectives. I am still passionate about human rights and I continue to learn more about them. I believe that everyone deserves to live a life free from discrimination and violence and I will continue to fight for the rights of all people. I eventually took a bigger role as treasurer and social media outreach to help promote our events and administered the clubs finances. Throughout the club our main goal was to help our high school change to renewable energy by the year of 2026 and we started a petition that would then go through. Additionally, I took part in activities that  promoted awareness of human rights and make a difference in my community. Joining the Human Rights Club was an incredibly rewarding experience and I am so glad that I did it.
","A way I have been able to express myself creatively to solve a problem is whenever Im stressed is going to the gym. The gym has helped me extremely in every aspect of my life, physically, emotionally, and mentally. Whenever something comes up I just go to the gym and the gym saves me from the problem. It feels essentially like I am one with the weights and nothing goes through my mind when I am in the gym other than pushing extreme and heavy amounts of weight. I even expressed this throughout my high school as I took lifting extremely seriously as I would meal prep meals for throughout the day to eat during the school day. I also started a powerlifting club in my high school where they would compete at the national level in different weight classes in the top 3 lifting exercises, squat, bench and deadlift and would compete to see who could lift the most.","

A community that has shaped part of my identity is where I'm from, my neighborhood in South Central Los Angeles which I already mentioned before in my application. Growing up, I have seen kids resort to gang violence and join gangs to raise money for their families. While this was never my story growing up, “it is as if south central has been trapped in the past, locking neighborhoods into concentrated poverty,” (Jan Analysis). My relationship to growing up in South Central however does not end there . I had the privilege of being able to attend school in West Los Angeles which is completely different from South Central, especially from a wealth and economic development perspective. Driving to school, I have noticed the smaller things, the more grocery stores and varieties that came with them, the countless more restaurants, as well as the many more banks, stores, theaters, etc. The other part of the city where I would commute to was radically different with a big part of this being part of a larger story of disparities in affluence Growing up and having to split my time between the two, I saw the difference in how economic inequality persisted in many different ways.  Personally, I take pride in knowing where I came from, but I would like to see my community in South Central LA flourish and get the help they deserve by being part of that change.

Obviously, working for a prestigious group like EIIG, which has been reigning on top of all the Business Clubs since 2014, would be a fantastic experience and an even better learning curve for me. Lastly, I believe it’ll be one hell of an experience for me to work under people such as Mr. Jonathan Ross, Ms. Kaavya Ramesh, and Ms. Saanvi Sood, with their experience in companies such as McKinsey & Company, Boston Consulting Group, and Pillantics (Ms. Sood’s startup aiming to go at war against opioids was something that caught my eye with its magnificent innovation). Lastly, it’ll be an honor to be a part of this revolutionary group.  

","An issue that I have always cared about is public health, and I have dreamed of a healthy society, free from diseases with an improved quality of life. My organization, The Khawhish Foundation primarily focuses on improving child welfare and providing everything they need for perfect health and well-being. 

The time of the pandemic changed our lives forever and hugely impacted the collective well-being of the society. In India, the situation was worse than the other countries. People were not only devoid of basic covid relief materials but also basic life necessities. Witnessing people not able to afford masks left my heart shattered. But what really moved me was when my house helper, the main earner of his family, passed away due to this pandemic.

Keeping this in mind, The Khawhish Foundation, found a new primary motive, providing covid relief material to everyone in need. We collaborated with one of India’s biggest non-profit organisations, Bhumi for conducting more than twenty Covid hygiene materials and food distribution drives in the slums. We visited all the BPL areas in the city distributing the relief materials from door to door. Seeing the  people content melted my heart. We also started a fundraiser, accumulating around Rs.20,000, for the  grieving family of my house help. 

I believe that helping even in the smallest manner possible can bring a significant change in someone’s life and it is absolutely essential for people to understand the significance of public health and contribute their part in serving the society.
","To accelerate my knowledge of entrepreneurship, I did a course at Columbia Business School called the ‘Venture for All’. I was assigned a team and was given the challenge to come up with a startup to achieve a Sustainable Development Goal (SDG). During the course, my team and I came up with the idea of Hinvon(hospital+India+inventory), which aims to connect people who faced a shortage of medical supplies to those with a surplus stack of unused medicines and achieve the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of Responsible Consumption and Production. The objective was to help people with the surplus to sell their products to those who couldn’t buy expensive medicines. Since the medicines were second-hand, the rates were lower than the market price, thus helping the buyer procure life-saving drugs. Our team was adjudged the winner, setting us apart from ten other groups.","
Theatre is an escape from reality for me. It lets me be whoever I want to be. The characters I’ve played have taught me so much about the shades of human moods and behavior. The process of getting under the skin of every character I portray is allows me to express my emotions freely while shedding inhibitions.


As a part of the Dramatics team since the 9th grade, I have always won several accolades in intra-school competitions encompassing Modern Shakespeare, Mock Advertisement, Street and Poetic plays. Motivated to nurture acting I Initiated a Dramatics Club in my school, in which I organize workshops every Saturday often inviting professionals to mentor our budding stars.

These experiences have improved my self-confidence and also helped me become a better orator and a people’s person. Theatre unlocked a hidden aspect of my personality, giving it a new dimension and allowing me to blossom to my full potential.

As someone passionate about both helping my community and studying gthe field of business, EIIG is an ideal fit. Unlike other clubs within Goizueta or Emory, EIIG prioritizes small business and community first. Through working with the small businesses of Atlanta I believe EIIG is a true force for good. Beyond the social cause aspect, I also appreciate how EIIG’s work involves many different aspects of business from risk analysis to consulting services, allowing for members to gain experience across a wide array of fields. EIIG’s diversity of interests and backgrounds is something that attracts me because I would be able to learn from the members of EIIG about social impact, business, and their unique interests. Additionally, I was impressed by EIIG’s record of 100% of small businesses paying back their loans, a testament to EIIG’s process. Should I be lucky enough to join EIIG, I hope to further pursue my interests in social impact through working with a special group of clients and analysts. In summary, EIIG includes each aspect of business I’m interested in while championing social causes that I support. "," This past year I served as the Events Chair for the Sports Analytics Club. This meant I facilitated new membership programs, planned world cup watch parties, and developed overall cohesion within the club. Some of my favorite work included planning a Q&A with the Atlanta Braves Assistant GM, Jason Paré. My passion for this work can be traced back to my interest in the quantitative side of sports. Although I have always enjoyed watching games, in the back of my mind I always considered whether a certain play call or roster move was the most statistically sound, drawing me to the analytics field. Unlike other clubs, the Sports Analytics Club was brand new on campus, meaning my team had a unique opportunity to reach prospective students with an interest in the field. Unfortunately, initial attendance and interest in the club was low, making it vital for us to plan events like Hackathon competitions and networking events to reach a greater audience. After seeing our club nearly double in size after a year, I found it extremely rewarding and reassuring because our work had helped nearly 100 students learn more about a potential career interest while having a fun time.

Last year, I served on the Oxford-Atlanta relations committee. As part of this role, I was tasked with connecting the two campuses separated by nearly 40 miles. Our goals were both to ease the transition to the Atlanta campus for Oxford graduates while also connecting the student body. Recently, the committee was tasked with finding a creative solution to revamp ATL Bound, a program aimed at transitioning Oxford graduates to the Atlanta campus. Many students gave feedback that the resources being provided through ATL Bound were hard to access or not as helpful as they hoped. In response, I offered ideas such as expanding the number of days and locations of ATL Bound events. Additionally, I suggested connecting Oxford students with a student on the Atlanta campus to answer questions and provide assistance with their assimilation. Based on feedback from the Student Involvement Coordinator, recent ATL Bound events have had doubled attendance and increased satisfaction.","At my high school there was a significant service requirement needed to graduate. Although I originally failed to see the relevance of this requirement, my opinions changed when I joined the Wexner Service Corps, a group of other Jewish teenagers from around Columbus interested in community service. Each week, we assembled at a different area of need around our city ranging from food pantries, soup kitchens, and community gardens in need of some love. Through this program, I was drawn closer to my city and I emerged with a new outlook. Instead of neglecting parts of my community I was unfamiliar with, I began to embrace every part of my city. Today, when I make a decision I make an effort to consider everyone in my community rather than only my close circle. Although I have left Columbus for college, I continue to apply these lessons everyday.",,3.5,0.486,0.045,

For some, a straightforward decision, while for others, a predicament requiring great reflection and deliberation. I am yet to arrive at a conclusion as both areas intrigue me. Emory Impact Investing Group (EIIG) will allow me to explore both fields concurrently as the organization integrates consulting and risk analysis together. Garnering experience and doing research through EIIG in both sectors will help guide my career through assisting me in reaching a decision. Moreover, if I pursue a career in startups, my experience with EIIG will prove exponentially valuable as most startups fail due to misguidance or lack of capital. 

Growing up in Atlanta, I have developed an emotional connection to the city, making witnessing firsthand the detrimental effects of the pandemic all the more heartbreaking. Hundreds of small businesses were forced to close, and I watched my father, a small business owner himself, struggle to adjust. Countless businesses are still struggling to claw their way out of the pandemic, many lacking capital or guidance in the new technology-oriented consumer markets. With EIIG, I hope to provide businesses that demonstrate a commitment to our community the opportunity to succeed as their success enhances our city. I hope to inspire as successful businesses not only elevate their areas, but they motivate other entrepreneurs. Finally, I wish to transform ideas into reality and give back to the community not only as an Emory student but as an Atlanta nat
","I sat alone, staring into the chaos of the cafeteria. The promise of four grade-determining exams inhabited my mind just as a virus commandeers a healthy cell. The new girl, Jessie, sat down across from me and glanced at the dark ovals under my expressionless eyes. She questioned, “Are you alright?” I nodded in response, but she furthered, “No, are you alright?” The floodgates opened as my silence broke, and the unbearable stress of my junior year was released. 

Through friends, I learned she was the founder of Project Mental Health Matters (PMHM), an organization geared toward de-stigmatizing mental health. I attended several PMHM sessions focused on establishing an environment where students felt comfortable discussing their anxieties. Over time, I felt my stress level diminishing and my overall sense of self improving, making me realize the importance of mental health over grades. Soon after, I joined PMHM with the goal of helping others cope just as Jessie helped me.

At PMHM, I became the Advocacy Director and earned a spot on the executive board. As the Advocacy Director, I led a research team of ten in exploring resourceful content for our socials. I also worked with our social media team and helped propel our Instagram to over fifty-thousand followers, generating attention from schools and other nonprofits. With our social media presence and our purpose of de-stigmatizing mental health, I know we made progress toward making mental health a more approachable subject for students and providing resources to those struggling.
","Relaxing, exciting, carefree: sensations a school holiday break should elicit. Exhausting, strenuous, demanding: my high school senior winter break encapsulated. From the countless application essays to the incessant tennis training, there was no respite. Slowly, I descended into a ceaseless, unrelenting cycle of fatigue and distress.

I escaped through music. I began taking hour-long breaks every day, either picking up my violin or sitting down at the piano. I had played both instruments for over a decade, yet had just now discovered their calming qualities. I found Beethoven on the violin and Schubert on the piano, both Romantic composers, to be most soothing. When I played, I cleared my mind, focusing solely on the music. Over time, I dramatically improved as my practicing became habitual, and I even improved my relationship with my parents, who, as musicians, had taught me everything I knew. 

","I stood in awe, ear pressed to the door, eyes shut, listening to the inexplicably rich Beethoven melody. Entranced, I failed to notice the door creak open. My father gingerly picked me up and handed me a petite violin. Whether from a tender legato or a powerful staccato, not another day passed without my music surging through the corridors of our home. 

My journey in music has become an integral part of my fondest memories with friends and family. Music has exposed me to the principles of self-expression and individuality as I have learned to convey my soul and emotions through interpretations of pieces. My resilient work ethic likewise originates in music since learning the piano and violin required years of discipline and perseverance. Lastly, music has significantly contributed to my understanding of the world, as the hidden nuances in pieces reveal traits of the cultures from which they originate. ",,3.5,0.493,0.144,

I love how the organization’s small team environment fosters an encouraging dynamic where I can hone my communication and analytical skills. I believe that these skills will provide me license to effectively work on projects with my fellow team members to positively impact the people of the Atlanta community.

","During my senior year of high school, I was the student liaison for The Collective of Concerned Black Professionals: an organization composed of members who are dedicated to enacting positive acts of change in communities all over the United States. While conducting research for the CCBP, I noticed that the pre-register to votes rate for my county was much lower than its surrounding communities.After weathering the effects of the 2016 election, I became acutely aware of what was at stake with the upcoming election; it compelled me to fully commit myself towards boosting this rate. Over the course of a couple months, I collaborated with my county's school board to organize an event that enunciated the importance of voting for my peers and provided a platform with which students could raise concerns they held about the institution. A plethora of students filled out voting pre-registry forms at the event and I was proud that I was able to make a difference in my community. I am passionate about this outreach because it allows disenfranchised individuals the opportunity to speak truth to power, participate in cultivating an empowering community,  and increase accessibility for future generations to comfortably cast their ballots. The voting system offers underprivileged and marginalized people of America a platform from which to speak their views. When the underrepresented vote, an additional degree of perspective is added to the political conversation.","Throughout high school, I was one of my school’s environmental proctors who were tasked with leading weekly informational sessions to raise awareness for environmental problems persisting within our school’s ecosystem. The biggest issue that we had to tackle was our school’s egregious trash problem; trash bins in hallways consistently overflowing with items that could be reused or recycled. The environmental team and I decided to contact a local farm to implement composting bins all over our school’s campus. These bins were collected once a week and had our school’s waste converted from organic material into soil fertilizer that could be used for the local farm’s crops. I wanted to motivate my schoolmates to use these composting bins instead of falling back into their old habits, so I proposed the idea that we molded each composting bin into a different sport. I designed the composting bins to imitate basketball hoops and other bins having mini-hockey sticks attached to them where the bin resembles a hockey goal. It was a really innovative project that collectively made our school more environmentally conscious and responsible.","During my short time on Emory’s Oxford Campus, I was able to meet a great community of people through the campus’s Black Student Association. I met an extensive amount of students who shared similar childhood experiences with me even though we all grew up in different parts of the world. It was encouraging and reassuring to know that I was not alone in experiencing first-hand racism throughout middle school and high school from attending predominantly white schools. I loved how the BSA community was able to create events around coming to terms with past traumatic experiences through the means of providing spaces for students to talk through their traumatic experiences — whether it be racism, sexism, abuse, etc.— to mentally grow and comes to terms with them.",,3.4791666666666665,0.485,0.064,

What drew me to EIIG specifically was the more ethical approach than all of the other clubs I met with.  I love the idea of investing both money and time into small businesses in the community, and the hands-on approach that EIIG takes to doing this.  I would love to dedicate myself to helping an aspiring entrepreneur in the community in any way that I can, and this club would allow me to get exposure to investment and the business world while doing something that I could be proud of. Additionally, the research side of EIIG was appealing to me as someone who is familiar with research in scientific fields.  I believe I can bring a certain amount of preexisting knowledge, and I am also interested in learning the process involved with research in this new field.  The community also stuck out to me in this club, seeing smiling faces when I entered the interest meetings, speaking with some of your members, and seeing the bond that you all have with each other.  This club immediately felt unique and refreshing, and I would love to be a part of it.","          At Camp Discovery, a camp for underprivileged kids that I volunteer at, I was paired up with a buddy, Josh. He shyly greeted me, hiding behind his big brother as I welcomed him with a warm smile. When we selected our activities, to my surprise, Josh picked art and music. I had envisioned shooting hoops with a younger version of myself, but my buddy loved drawing, crafts, and singing. Since I was responsible for Josh enjoying camp, I had to support him in these endeavors, even though they were uncharted territory for me.
           As my brother excitedly took his buddy to play frisbee, I unenthusiastically headed to the art room. However, when I saw Josh with a blue crayon and a huge smile on his face, I followed suit and discovered that drawing could be quite calming. Throughout the week, I participated in the arts, ending with a concert for the whole camp. As a reserved person, performing was nerve-wracking, but I did it for Josh. 
          I never realized that making others happy could be better than helping myself until I was forced to make beaded jewelry and dance in front of my peers.  But the smile on Josh’s nine-year-old face was priceless. I grew as a person and am now more willing to try new things such as drawing, which I now love.  More importantly, I found that to please those you care about, pushing your comfort zone is a small price to pay.","In high school, I watched many of my peers abuse drugs, starting with alcohol and vaping, but often growing worse from that point.  I did not know how to prevent this, but then I decided to join Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) to combat this. We hung posters and warned of the dangers of drug use, but I was dissatisfied with the ineffectiveness of our actions. The following year I became president of SADD and came up with the idea of inviting a former drug abuser into the school to talk to the students.  We set up an event in which a recovering heroin addict spoke to the school of the terrible journey she went on, and cautioned the students of the dangers of addiction.  There was notably less drug use in the months following this presentation, and I feel that we made a lasting impact on some individuals.","All of last year I worked as a waiter in an Indian restaurant in my hometown. I learned how to serve with almost no training whatsoever, and taught myself the names of all the dishes which were completely new to me.

This job was challenging and not particularly high paying, but I became part of the family there, getting my picture hung on the wall, attending gatherings and birthdays, and they even gifted me a watch before I left for college.

As an Economics and Mathematics student, I always believe that the knowledge on the textbook is relatively monotonous; also, the theory is based on comparatively few real-life situations, which is not able to provide enough guidance for students’ career life. Intuitively speaking, we absorb and digest a massive amount of content through lectures every day; however, many people, including me, understand quite little about the meaning and directed application of this knowledge. As a result, my sense of purpose would be weaker, and it’s natural for me to be in confusion and anxiety about the future. 

In this case, the value of the EIIG is highlighted. It successfully builds a bridge, connecting real society with campus life and circulating Goizueta's information and resources to more students interested in business. Through the summer internship, I acquired a certain level of understanding of the consulting industry, but I knew minimal about the rest of the areas and corresponding expertise. At EIIG, by practicing real investment and networking with outstanding peers, I could also scrutinize myself, discovering shortcomings and flaws to compensate for deficiencies as soon as possible; more importantly, I want to work with all peers to make our community a better place.

EIIG is known in Emory for its professionalism and foresight, and I look forward to progressing with my excellent peers at EIIG and to one day contributing back to more people with its vast resources.","I used to work as a part-time intern at Student Medicover (SM), an insurance company that aims to provide international students with affordable insurance products, and it has been well-recognized for its affordability. However, I found that most clients often felt confused and overwhelmed when claiming since SM didn’t have a complete instruction book.

After noticing that, I contacted two other interns to write a Chinese version of the insurance user manual. We started with basic concepts, such as how to claim for bills. Then we discussed several common issues, like how to choose the nearest doctors on the UnitedHealth website. We took the text and accompanying pictures concisely, clearly, and beautifully, and our work was eventually adopted by the company and distributed among clients. 

Writing the instruction book is the most meaningful work I’ve done since it not only helps the company improve its product but also serves the greater community. I believe that the work of our team can significantly help international students overcome the difficulties of getting medical services in the U.S. For SM, although this work may cause it to suffer in the short term due to the increase in customer claims, the increase in the number of people who have actually used the insurance will certainly result in more positive feedback in the long run. ","Last summer, I worked for KANTAR. My first assignment was to write a questionnaire with my peers for a liquor company to help itself know the popularity of its product among people aged 40 to 50 with stable incomes in first-tier cities in China. The questionnaire was dozens of questions long. 

However, before the online questionnaire was released, I realized that many participants might not necessarily fit the target group. In such a case, their responses would not count, and collecting their responses would undoubtedly waste the time of both participants and our employees. To solve this problem, I placed the questions related to the respondent's background at the top and proposed that the company should terminate the questionnaire for non-target respondents. Therefore, the non-target group only needs to answer the top questions to be redirected to the ""End of the Questionnaire.” Finally, my proposal was adopted. ","Practicing Chinese Calligraphy was the most villainous experience in my childhood. Unlike pen, the Chinese brush is soft, requiring plentiful practice for learners to be proficient in using it. So the practice process was tedious—starting with imitating, I needed to carefully study and follow famous calligraphers’ styles thoroughly hundreds of times. 

Nevertheless, the grueling practice has inadvertently shaped several valuable qualities for me. Using a soft brush to write down powerful calligraphy, every learner must be diligent, patient, and careful enough to capture tiny details. As an old Chinese saying goes, “the style of writing is the style of the man.” 

Almost fifteen years have passed since the first day I stepped into calligraphy school. Although I’m still far from being a qualified calligrapher, by conquering numerous obstacles, I have been equipped with qualities to be excellent: persistent, industrious, and the spirit of endeavoring to do even better.

","Working in the fields with my cousins on a winter break, I learned about destitute poverty and gender discrimination in that Guizhou Mountain Area village. Newborn girls were sent away for their gender. Village girls are forced to quit school at 15, working at factories to support their brother's marriage. I met Feifei, a girl greatly interested in dancing but discouraged from pursuing her dream since ""dancing could not bring food or enable her to find a fine husband."" Feifei reminds me of the eight years old me who stood in front of my father with tears, defending her ballet class that was viewed as a waste of time and energy. I felt the purge that I must do something to help Feifei, also the little me, pursue her dream.

Wishing to make a change, I started an online dance studio – Dreamer – to teach dancing to Feifei and other interested girls from Guizhou's mountainous areas for free. Twice a week, I taught ballet online to eight girls aged ten who demonstrated a passion for dance. After class, I also help them with homework and chat, encouraging girls to pursue higher education. I want to help the girls who face gender discrimination in their families explore a possible way to apply for higher education. I know my little efforts may be far from enough to alter their lives, but I wish to lighten their lives even by a little through this small online studio.

The market pushes the individual to preserve only themselves and their own organization. We, in business, have no room to look after one another or the underprivileged. Holding this belief, I felt like I was letting go of a part of myself that I held dear by pursuing business. I wanted to help those around me. Though I needed to financially survive for my family and myself, I knew that many others were in desperate need of help. 
	Taking an immense amount of risk, my family settled down in this country and started a small business. Unfortunately, our business lasted only a year. Our family went through much turmoil in the following years in an effort to recover from our financial endeavor. I imagine what would have been if we were blessed with a helping hand then. By joining EIIG, I wish to be that helping hand.
	Seeing these budding businesses, I see family; I see my passion reignited and my yearning for altruism once again flourish. I wish for these businesses, and these families to not struggle with the experiences that my own had gone through. I wish to complete the circle that my family had lined out for me, not to be selfish or self-preserving, but whole and relentlessly giving.

","Many of my friends are pursuing careers in music. As a music lover, I deeply admire their courage to showcase their art out into the world and follow their passions. However, though their resolve is strong, musicians often find trouble in gaining publicity and attention.
	Knowing their struggles and aspirations, I wanted to help my friends with their artistic efforts. I decided to provide a platform where my friends could perform live music to a large audience and display their talents before the public. Over three months, I contacted various non-profit organizations in my city and compiled a schedule of all their public events. I introduced these organizations to my friends’ music and requested a spot in their events for my friends to perform. The majority were thrilled to hear my offer.
	We then booked around ten events around my city where my friends were able to freely present their songs. We went to churches, hospitals, retirement homes, schools, and parks. Slowly, my friends began to gain attention and popularity, which then eventuated in our biggest venue.
	My friends and I were invited to perform at the opening of a large art exhibition in Seoul, South Korea in front of over a thousand attendees. I was immensely proud of my friends and relieved that my efforts had helped them gain a voice in the music community. Through this experience, I realized that, with initiative and drive, dreams need not remain as dreams, but as manifestations and reality.
","	I come from a religious family. Both my grandfather and father are pastors. I greatly admire them for their commitment and strong adherence to their values. However, I disagree with many of my family’s beliefs. Throughout my life, I have realized that I hold a different worldview. 
	There was bound to be conflict. I, however, wanted to face this disagreement in a respectful and civil manner. To deal with this issue, I came up with a conversation framework for both me and my father, which involved set times to speak, verbal boundaries preventing swift personal attacks and judgments, and guidelines to embrace each other’s opinions. 
	Though it felt silly to contract my father and myself to such a strict conversational format, our interaction was quite fruitful and moving. We eventually learned to meet in the middle, to respect and love each other regardless of each other’s beliefs.
","My family has shaped me. As mentioned above, my family is devoutly religious, and I too was raised under faith. Though my beliefs have changed, I still hold dear the lessons that my family has taught me; to be kind, loving, humble, selfless, and empathetic.

Though I do not know what the future holds, I sincerely wish to reach the impact that my family has brought upon my community, reaching out to those in need and suffering, to deliver them peace and hope.

Smaller businesses play a significant role in supporting social causes by using sustainable methods through resources in order for their companies. This is something I believe is of high importance and should recognize because it contributes towards the overall welfare of the people and the environment. Most importantly, microbusinesses create more job opportunities and improve the quality of life for low-income groups, which is necessary for creating equality in the community. EIIG’s initiative to provide loans and early-stage financing are imperative to support these businesses' growth at a larger scale in the market. 
EIIG not only support social causes but pushes its members to step outside of their comfort zone and build an all-rounder skillset that is of utmost use. EIIG combines both the financial and consulting perspectives into the club, which is something that other clubs at Emory don't provide. This will bolster my analytical thinking and make me grow as a learner because I will be able to explore different managerial avenues through one club 


","As a leader, I took 3 months to contact NGOs and organizations working with schools. Through numerous zoom meetings, I persuaded them on how the students will benefit from understanding cultural norms and appreciating collaboration across their borders - a key element as we become more international. With countless roadblocks, I finally found 15 mentors and the 3 participating schools. 

I facilitated the discussion through zoom over the course of 4 days. I created a sense of comfort by conducting virtual team-building activities, allowing students to gain confidence. I realized the coordinators needed detailed instructions- cultural nuances- to which I was very thorough allowing the meetings to be well organized. As the discussions progressed, I asked guiding questions to help students analytically think and make connections. 

The coordinator from one of the schools left a message saying “ thanks to you, participants have become friends and it won't be an exaggeration to say that the seminar has been catalytic in forging strong ties between not just individuals but also cultures”. This one-on-one experience not only taught me to empathize as a leader but grow as a learner, which is important as we start live in a more globalized world. 

","“The customer is always right” resonated through my textbooks.  However, I questioned, “did this generate money?”. I did an internship with a social media company, where I helped launch their new product that allows content creators to easily connect with their fans. The company has a strong customer base but was operating at a loss. I realized that I could use customer loyalty in order to gain profitability for the company. Therefore, I presented a compelling financial model by studying the content creators' behaviors, tailored to their story, showing how they can individually maximize revenue. From this, the overall retention rates increased by 20%. The idea of this was to gain content creators in the long run so that the marginal costs would go down for the company. This answered the initial question because focusing on the customer and their needs would in turn lead to generating more money.  
","I used to live in Thailand, and dance was celebrated because of the connection it creates between dancers and the Buddha. Outside most temples, I would see a group of women beautifully dancing to the beats of local instruments. However, I would hesitate to learn about the dance forms because of the stereotypes that filled my ears about the lack of acceptance. 
One day, one of the dancers invited me to dance along with them. We emanated infectious energy – communicating our shared story of tradition through a plethora of minute bodily gestures. I realized then that I was living with a pre-convied notion about the inability to acculturate with different societies. I found my community with these dancers, from which my values of inclusivity were formed. I now own a dance academy where I not only teach dance forms from back home in India but Thai styles as well.

2023-01-27 14:00:09.739,R,,BBA (Finance) + QSS,Sophomore,Asian,Analyst,"As an individual, I have always recognized the importance of local entrepreneurs and micro businesses, and there are almost 31 million of them in the US, which is a substantial part of the country’s GDP. Hailing from a family which owned a small micro enterprise in India, I have known first-hand about how difficult it is to find sufficient loans and access to capital, as well as well-known consultants to help with strategy-making in the business. When I heard about EIIG, I was really excited, as the organization helps the growth of micro businesses, using research and professional development that they cannot normally afford. This ties in perfectly with my goal of wanting to go beyond simple consulting with a profit mindset to actually effectuating social progress with the community. The 21st century is a data-driven age, where decisions are based on data analytics, and I feel that EIIG keeps in mind this factor, something which I have a lot of passion for, especially when I interned in a data-driven energy company, using Python to manipulate large amounts of data. According to studies, businesses are 20 plus times more likely to get new clients if they are data driven, and EIIG’s quantitative mindset can attract local entrepreneurs in this way. Therefore, I believe that my knowledge and desire to create a substantial impact in the society really ties in with the vision of EIIG which is to close the micro-business gap for the better, and therefore transform peoples’ lives.  ","Helping the community has always been a goal and passion of mine since high school, and I have always wanted to create a social impact in the world, especially in terms of financial literacy. Two years ago, our domestic help implored my mother for monetary help as she was about to be homeless overnight. Her financial insecurity perturbed me, so I decided to lend her a helping hand. Understanding the nuances of savings and compound interest, I helped her open a savings account, which aided her during a financial emergency. Realizing the impact of my intervention, I felt compelled to think about how I could institutionalize and scale a financial literacy project. I conceived and proposed a program to two non-profit organizations, with whom I had been volunteering over the past two years. The idea was to counsel young adults, to demonstrate to them through data the long term benefits of financial prudence, and to open their savings accounts to enable them to put their learning to work and build financial security for themselves. I started educating 16 people, working with them to understand their spending and costs, and taught them how to manage their money. The economic lockdown brought on by the pandemic exacerbated severe poverty in India. Despite having poor financial history, these 16 individuals managed to keep their families financially afloat during this time because of the project. This outcome encouraged me contact more organizations, where I expanded the scale of my project, building on my passion. ","During the pandemic, I worked for a non-profit organization to help underprivileged children learn math and sciences. Our organization needed funds to help the children stay at a good location, and for that, I decided to organize an online fundraising musical concert, where I partnered up with 8 of the best musicians in the city of Indore in India, and we played for around 300 people online, which was a really creative way to try and gather funds, as all offline methods of fundraising were closed due to the COVID-19 lockdown. We ended up raising more than $2500, and used this for the children’s education and living costs. Doing the concert not only helped me with the fundraising, but also helped me use my musical creativity to solve a problem with other people.

","There is a famous quote: “If you don’t know where you come from, how will you know where you are going?” Originally from central India, I have been part of the Hindu religion community since childhood. My family owned an ancestral Hindu Temple that is more than 300 years old, and this community has had an important role in the shaping of my identity There is a belief in Hinduism about ‘dharma’, meaning that whatever you do in life, it should be f truthful. This has really motivated me to follow ethical objectives, and stories of how my ancestors faced hardships during India’s freedom struggle really impacted me deeply, shaped my mind and made me who I am. They taught me that people strive to change the situation but you should be the agent of change, something that I have kept in mind in any challenging situation I have faced.

The collaboration and input from peers and seniors are integral to reaching my goals and my experience at Goizueta Business School. I am looking to join EIIG, which has ambitious plans for the future, has a team of passionate people who want to work with high standards, and also looks forward to exchanging ideas with EIIG members. A community where we can exchange our experiences in consulting while giving back to the community by supporting local businesses.

I believe I am a strong candidate for becoming an Analyst based on my experience (leading a group of analysts in Everview Consulting), hard-working nature, and ability to fit into teams quickly.","My friend and I have been co-presidents of the Drone Club since junior year of high school. We teach students how to build their drones from scratch. To lead other students, I researched every component involved in building drones, everything from ESCs to airfoils to swash plates. Much of my time went into condensing what I knew into a simple teachable lesson. For example, looking at an R-22 helicopter, I learned that a helicopter needs a tail rotor due to torque reaction. I explained this concept to other students by explaining Newton’s 3rd law and offered a visual representation of the individual force components of a helicopter. This process not only deepened my understanding of physics and aerospace but also gave me a greater appreciation for the hard work behind lesson planning. 

Taking this interest further, I participated in drone-related seminars, joined a global forum (only student in group consisting of mostly teachers/adults) sharing experience on drones and its club management for their perspective schools, and visited the aircraft manufacturing plant as well as aviation convention in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. 
I also created my first object and began uploading my 3D projects – car wheels, gears, nuts and bolts - online, hoping they could help others, generating over eight thousand downloads and counting.

Overall, DIY Drone Club was a significant activity for me as it has allowed me to pursue an interest and learn a large variety of things, from managing inventory (hundreds of drone parts) to teaching/leadership skills and a greater ability to problem-solve. ","I was tasked to increase membership of Drones club - down to the single digits. I needed to make our club stand out from the competition: FTC robotics and MATE robotics.

After careful consideration, I proposed attracting members by flying drones during the recruitment event. I also shared my idea to market our club as an introduction to hands-on experience with engineering and robotics. We could welcome students of all skill levels and have our experienced members help them work at their own pace, allowing our club to be marketed toward everyone interested in engineering compared to drones alone. 

Our supervisor and members agreed with the proposal, and this strategy proved to be a huge success. Many students were attracted to the flying drones of our booth and signed up when learning about the low bars to entry. This new recruitment process increased active club membership from 5 to 32.","While attending Babson's summer study of Entrepreneurial Thought and Action, I was a part of a community of like-minded individuals - striving to learn and innovate and overflowing with entrepreneurial passion. In this environment, I also had the opportunity to connect with many successful alums, such as Mike Filbey, founder of Cbay.
We discussed venture pitches and his entrepreneurial journey through phone calls and zoom meetings. I asked about the impact of being part of an innovative community; he told me an environment fostering an entrepreneurial mindset was crucial. Through my experience at Babson, I truly believed it.
EIIG is a hotpot of unique yet like-minded individuals – striving to learn and innovate.

As a low-income, first-generation college student I can understand the struggle impoverished people, especially entrepreneurs, have trying to leave the poverty cycle and I believe this program can be beneficial for startup companies to expand. I would like to create a micro-business after college related to cyber security software engineering and I want to grow to be a large company. In America, many small businesses do not succeed for a long time, only about 25% survive for the past 15 years and the leading issue is the lack of capital and financial literacy. If I joined EIIG, I would be connected with students on campus with the similar interest of Business in mind and we could collaborate on ideas to be a better businessperson for our life after college. Therefore, our companies are not among the 75% of companies that dissolve. The club would be useful in teaching me the valuable skills I would need to succeed in that venture. I am majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Business, but I may consider double majoring after exploring this club’s activities. ","I was immensely passionate about the American Red Cross back in high school. I did many of the disaster relief activities in my hometown and did other humanitarian work, such as mapping areas around the world that have poor mapping because of manmade conflicts or natural disasters ruining the landscape. I was a volunteer for the Red Cross at first, then I decided to charter a Red Cross Club at my high school. I planned and did many club events to help the Red Cross reach its goals aligning with its mission statement; One of the most memorable events was the blood drive and Cards for Vets where members created holidays cards that are given to veterans in our local community. As the president of my high school’s Red Cross club, I saw how many people of similar interests in the medical field connect with each other to help each other aspire to their goals. The Red Cross and EIIG clubs both share a similar sense of fellowship among its members and of helping to improve communities. I find both clubs to be important for both of those virtues because it motivates me to put in my best work to assist more people. ","In my English class, we had a final exam project where we had to work in partners to create a podcast discussing common themes related to the class’s theme of monstrosity and to societal issues in any horror film. My partner and I spent many hours brainstorming ideas for our podcast including: a logo and title for our podcast, writing a script, movies to focus on, how we would both address the themes in the podcast, and find the program we would use to record and edit. We had to do a lot of planning, but we used our creativity to create an interesting funny podcast that was interactive. The most challenging part was creating a logo that was relevant to our topic, but we managed to create an intuitive one so the audience can look at it and know exactly what we are going to clearly communicate.","As a Kenyan American who has lived in Raleigh, North Carolina for most of my life I embrace individuality. I have acquired a unique mixed culture being brought up from my close-knit African and Southern sides of the family that has crafted me to have an expansive taste in music genres and be a friendly person that stays determined with my career-wise goals in life while volunteering my efforts to help people in need. In group settings, I tend to be the welcoming one that tries to foster collaboration and settle conflicts. With individuality, people can craft their culture and bond with people who share similar ideals.

Personally, my career interests revolve around the STEM world, but my hope is to one day have my own company, promoting innovation in either the biotech world or the biomedical world. All opportunities to work with small businesses and gain experience and knowledge in how companies grow interest me. In my own life, I have plenty of experience working with small businesses, but I would like to have a larger influence and more professional experience with them. My mother worked freelance for most of my childhood and I have recently worked for a small designer bag company Corroon. I have also done work with my aunt's startup, working freelance for major companies like the conglomerate LVMH. That said, all of the actual companies I have experience with were able to fund themselves. I have had friends and family have very good ideas, but no way of funding them themselves. I believe that plenty of innovative, world-changing people and ideas are unable to execute due to insufficient funding, or fear of taking risks that could ruin lives. Atlanta has plenty of passionate entrepreneurial minds who may not be able to apply for loans. EIIG creates amazing opportunities for the Atlanta community and promotes both innovation and development of underprivileged communities. As someone from a working class neighborhood with an entrepreneurial mind, this strongly appeals to me. ","Due to the shutdowns in 2020, my school did not have a track season. So, a fellow teammate and I decided to organize a fundraising event with other members of our track team. The concept was similar to a walk-a-thon: participating athletes would raise funds for the charity “God’s Love We Deliver” by having people sponsor them for each mile they completed. The event took place over one day and at the start of every hour athletes would join a zoom call and run a mile. I was passionate about organizing this event as I had devised the original plan and made the connections to have the concept come to life in the first place. I also cared about the work “God’s Love We Deliver” had provided for NYC and Westchester County, especially during the HIV epidemic. Due to Covid, they needed additional funds for their facilities and to be able to help the sickly in the NYC-metropolitan area. Organizing with GLWD, the athletes participating, and the contributors so they knew the amount of money they would end up donating was challenging, but was worth it after raising over $11K during this event and personally completing all 24 hours of the challenge. ","There is a brook in my neighborhood that runs through the middle school and highschool campuses, two parks, and flows into the Long Island Sound. The water quality fails by over 50 times the legal limit of coliform density(10 coliforms/mL), causing damage to the neighboring environment and people, predominantly in the lower-income areas. My solution to this problem stemmed from a science experiment where I used Pleurotus ostreatus and straw to create a barrier across the waterway, testing before and after filtration. Before the barrier the water was averaging around 500 coliforms/mL and after the barrier averaged 7 coliforms/mL, supporting the legitimacy of this design. I was later accepted into a fellowship program where I was given funding to work with nonprofit Save the Sound producing a few dozen barriers across multiple points in the waterway, effectively reducing the contamination of the waterway.
","Working with my mom on construction jobs shaped my childhood and my own values. By four years old my mom had me taping off walls and sanding floors. While other kids were going to camp making crafts over the summer, I was often working forty hours a week, gaining professional experience working freelance painting the interiors of the homes of the one percent. Working freelance gave me insights into two different worlds, the social elite, and the working class. I met some of the most unique people and friends on job sites. Since my mom’s work revolves around murals, the job sites normally consisted of creative, high energy workers, who taught me the value of work ethic.

2023-01-27 09:39:35.987,R,,Finance,Sophomore,Asian,Both,"I want to join EIIG for three reasons mainly. First of all, focus on the breadth and depth of early-stage investing. In high school, I participated in two entrepreneurial programs hosted by Babson College and Wharton School. Since then, I've developed a passion for entrepreneurship and have worked in several private equity and venture capital firms. Joining EIIG will allow me to hone my technical skills and better prepare me for a future career in the VC and Private Equity field. Secondly, EIIG's mission aligns with my goals. I've always resonated with the financial challenges faced by small business owners. My parents have started several small ventures, and financing has always been a significant struggle. At EIIG, we can finance local business owners' dreams while generating a profit for the organization. Lastly, I look forward to bonding with my like-minded peers and building relationships that will benefit us for years. EIIG is known for being a close-knit community that supports each other. I would improve myself in such a nurturing environment and help others to grow along the way. ","I am more proud of nothing than my involvement in charity and community service. One of the most outstanding achievements in my life was back in high school when I graduated with the most community service hours in my school. Although the school only requires 15 hours of community service yearly, I did well over a hundred hours each year. When I donated supplies to a local public elementary school in a low-income community, nothing beat the experience of seeing how the children's faces would light up for a new pencil case or coloring book. Community Service and charity are essential because I understand that I am very privileged for the position I am in within my life. At the same time, many people around the world have no access to higher education or even put food on the table. My parents grew up in a harsh environment, so I've always been taught to carry greater responsibility than myself and help those in need in all possible ways. I would love to carry this initiative forward at EIIG.","Having creative solutions is particularly helpful when faced with limited or unreliable data. One of the best examples is when I research potential acquisition targets for GreenTree Capital. A project that gained much interest from my manager was a multifamily property priced at $3 million. The seller claimed a consistent vacancy rate below 5% and met all investment metrics. Nevertheless, instead of taking the numbers at face value, I proposed to travel to the location and see for myself. I surveyed with questions regarding the property and its vicinity, interviewed the tenants on the street, and collected enough data that ensured statistical significance. The result showed that the low vacancy rate could only be achieved during peak seasons, and many tenants are struggling to pay rent. I could prevent a potentially unprofitable investment by tackling the issue creatively. ","My Chinese origin is an indispensable part of my identity. I was raised in a household where Confucius's beliefs and traditional customs are significantly emphasized. I recited the Confucius Analect and learned the power of benevolence, filial piety, and discipline. Those values had a tremendous impact on how I act and treat others. As I moved to the States at 13, I learned to continue celebrating my Chinese heritage in this great melting pot of cultures. With my involvement in the Chinese student organization in high school and at Emory, I've strived to spread Chinese history and culture to a broader audience. During times of Asian hate, I marched on the streets to call for creating a safer environment for the Asian community. I will continue to be proud of my Chinese heritage and maintain a high moral standard. ",,3.3125,0.452,-0.069,

Coming to Atlanta, I found this great opportunity to serve free coffee and doughnuts on Sunday mornings in Midtown Atlanta as breakfast to anyone passing by. Despite being a luxurious region in Atlanta, most of those getting it were people from underprivileged areas. What was most impactful to me was that some of them would even come back after a few minutes to see if they could get more because they did not have that at home. This has been a significant experience because it broke the bubble I was in, helping me realize how many people are in need in Atlanta and how I can help them. Now, I want to move to the next level and positively impact the Atlanta community by joining a unique organization like EIIG.
	By helping micro-businesses to thrive through micro-loans, I not only want to have a meaningful impact on their lives but also learn about these businesses.

A significant moment for me was helping my friends with their Calculus I final exam at the end of the last semester. Since some of my friends were asking for help with some exercises for their exams, I decided to reunite all of them at the ground level of the library to give lessons and practice questions. We stayed at the library for three consecutive nights, from 8 pm until 2 am. During this time, even people from outside started to join. After all of this, I was pleased to know that not only I could increase their grades significantly, but I helped them overcome their fear of Calculus.

Halfway through the trip, we would go to Edinburgh, spend a few days, and come back. As soon as we got to Edinburgh, after a five-hour journey by train, we went to our hotel, and to our surprise, it was not what we expected. Since my family had not been together for four months, we wanted to spend a good and peaceful time together, but I knew that this would potentially ruin the rest of the trip. I started to research by myself and compare based on the price, location of the tourist points, and quality. After a few hours, I found a perfect place for us to stay, and I asked my father to go there and make sure the hotel was as good as it seemed. We got there, I asked to have a tour and see the rooms, and we closed the deal, enjoying both the city and the hotel as a family.","	I have never had a big group of friends. I used to be friends with some specific people, and they had their groups, but I was never part of them. It was tough growing up like this because I would never get invited when my friends went out, so I was pretty lonely.

	Because of this, I was afraid of coming to Emory: new country, new cultures, new people; I was skeptical of fitting in.

The ability to explore different career pathways is crucial to me because I haven't yet decided what career I want to go into. After several cancer diagnoses in my family, I concluded that I wanted to go into the medical field, but it wasn’t until last semester that I realized there are other pathways into this field apart from medical school. Now, I plan to go into the medical business industry, but I am undecided on which pathway to pursue. The due diligence branch is enticing to see if a career in traditional finance suits me. I am also excited to try the consulting branch because it would allow me to gain experience working with businesses and learning how to advise effectively.

Many Idahoans take these activities for granted, but, if we disregard nature, we will inevitably lose access to it. These activities that I love rely on the trails that weave throughout Idaho. Because of this passion, I applied and was selected to participate in the inaugural youth trail restoration program. I participated on the same trip two years later; this time, recruiting a group of my peers. These trips were both physically and mentally exhausting. We abandoned modern comforts and cohabitated with ticks and spiders for a week. Despite the discomfort, we succeeded in manually clearing over ten miles of trails that hadn't been accessible in over a decade. I learned that even at a young age, I can make an impact. By opening up these trails, we prevented further damage to ecosystems caused by erosion. Giving people access to nature is a gift in itself, but by giving them access, they will begin to respect it and take action themselves.","Before high school, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe reached out to my school and asked it to change its racially insensitive name and mascot. When I arrived, we had switched from the Braves to the Brave, yes an adjective, and our symbol became the “B”. After 2 years of donning the fierce “B” to all of our sporting events, Our student council was tasked with selecting a mascot. The principal wanted a Greek warrior, but we agreed that this was cliche. So, I pitched the “Olympians” with Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, as the mascot. This kept with the principal’s wish for a Greek theme and alluded to our academics and athletics. I also collaborated with the others to create the “Boise Bison.” It was a nod to our school’s strength, and raised awareness for the endangered species important to many Native Americans. In the end, the “Bison” was chosen.

My neighborhood is a community that has shaped so much of my identity. I grew up on the corner of seventh street surrounded by children my age and younger.

For over a year, I had been publishing my writing, more specifically poetry, under KidSpirit, a global online magazine that has served as a creative outlet and critical opportunity to express my deep-rooted passion for literature. Whether it was writing a cultural poem, scientific book review, or media article, I always jumped at the opportunities that the KidSpirit team offered. 

However, when I received the email from their editorial assistant inviting me to start a local editorial board, I was hesitant to reply. Can I– a novice writer– be worthy of running an entire group of students with no experience or familiarity? After hesitations and doubts ran through my head, I decided to take on the challenge– recruiting interested students, coordinating with Kidspirit, and setting up meetings. While we started off with awkward introductions and hesitant peer review critiques, our board slowly flourished in inspiration and creativity within each monthly meeting. 

My experience with starting an editorial board made me realize that my false perception of a leader wasn’t the dominating, know-all image that I had always pictured, but instead someone who encourages, aids, and listens to their peers. At times when my young editors grew to engage in deep, thought-provoking conversations, I felt I had made my mark as a true leader. ","One way I express myself is through art and communicating myself through different forms of mediums, whether that’s performative mediums such as dance and music, or visual art itself. Especially in dance, I find it fascinating how I can utilize my body to convey certain feelings and emotions without having to use any words. 

As an artist, I especially find that creative arts hold economic benefits for various stakeholders, creating jobs in the market while promoting diverse cultures and opinions. After the pandemic shifted the notion of art away from just physical interactions, I was fascinated by creators’ innovative implementation of art through accessible platforms, like online Colosseum tours, realistic live-streaming concerts, and interactive virtual-reality Van Gogh exhibits. This adaptability highlights the industry’s business significance, and I find interest ad great passion in creating art for others to not only consume but also value. ","As our neighborhood barely peaked above flood waters, the true greatness of compassionate human service astonished me: volunteers– some from hundreds of miles away– risked their lives to distribute supplies and deliver us to safety. Despite Hurricane Harvey’s devastating impact, our subsequent “Houston Strong” mentality has instilled in me an appreciation for the strength of the community. 

The resulting lesson in philanthropy prompted me to join the non-profit We Care Act dedicated to disaster relief. Initially a local event to help install computers for technologically illiterate refugees, it soon burgeoned to a global donation of computers and ebook copies to underprivileged communities. 

Even as I continue my mission throughout the pandemic in leading COVID relief projects or providing PPE to frontline workers and creating an accessible online student COVID guide, I remain grateful for the We Care Act community as we come together to serve others in return. ",,3.25,0.442,-0.088,
2023-01-27 12:18:53.053,R,,BBA and Economics,Freshman,Asian,Both,"I am eager to join Emory Impact Investing Group (EIIG) as a first-year student studying economics and business because it is an organization that aligns with my values and interests. At Emory, I have been exposed to the importance of ethical investing practices and their positive impact on the world. The EIIG has a mission to mobilize students to become involved in impact investing and to spread awareness of the benefits of impact investing and sustainable finance.

I am passionate about using my economic and business knowledge to promote social change. Through EIIG, I will have the opportunity to gain an understanding of the impact investing sector and how to create positive change through investing. I believe that I have the potential to make a significant contribution to the organization and learn from experienced members. I look forward to being part of a team of like-minded individuals and contributing my knowledge to further the organization's mission.

I am a hardworking and driven individual and I strive to make a positive difference in the world. I am excited to grow my knowledge of impact investing and apply this to the work of the EIIG. I am confident that I can bring enthusiasm, dedication, and creativity to the group and contribute to the success of EIIG. I strongly believe that the skills and knowledge I gain from the group can be used to help further my career and also benefit the world.
","Picture a girl in a village - playing, cycling, swimming - having the best time of her life. Reluctantly, she has to leave. Kamshet isn't her home. She grew up in a metropolis, visiting the village only for summer retreats. But her heart is yet to move on from the kaccha roads of the rural paradise.			
That girl is me.						
I considered Kamshet as only a destination for vacation, but it was home to many resident children there. And while it was a beautiful place to live in, it was not equipped to provide quality education to eager students. As I grew up, I decided to take matters into my own hands. I started small - just a few visits to acquaint myself with the children, making friends, playing games, and slipping in a word or two about the importance of education. Slowly, my involvement increased. Kamshet experiences harsh winters every year, and most children cannot afford thermal wear to keep them warm. And so, they stop attending school. With support from my family, I provided them with adequate thermal wear to ensure their education is not impeded. During the pandemic, as the schools came to a standstill, I created a book for the little ones. It helped them learn the alphabet and numbers with several exercises to make it engaging and enjoyable. It wasn't just a charitable activity for me, it was a passion project. Talking to them, playing with them, and interacting with them was the highlight of it all. They saw a friend in me and I saw my past in them. They had been dealt a bad hand, but it was in their hands to change that. I just wanted to empower them to become capable of that. It reminds me of what my grandfather would often say when I was just as young as my friends at Kamshet - ""Muhammad goes to the mountain, the mountain doesn't come to Muhammad."" ","One way I have been able to express myself creatively to solve a problem related to business is by creating visual representations of data. This can be done through the use of charts, graphs, diagrams, and other visuals that help people to better understand complex concepts. By visually representing data, I can identify patterns and trends that may not be obvious through traditional methods. This can be used to help a company make better decisions and improve its operations. Additionally, creating visual representations of data can help to create a better understanding of the company’s financial health and performance, which can be used to develop strategies for growth and profitability. By using visual representations of data, I have been able to effectively explain complex concepts and provide insight into the business, which has helped to solve a variety of problems.
","A community that has been integral in shaping my identity is the community of my peers. Over time, I have made close connections with friends and classmates who have had a strong influence on my values and outlook on life. We have shared experiences and joys, challenges, and hardships. Through it all, I have learned how to be compassionate, understanding, and supportive – all values that I now strive to live by. The community of my peers has also been a consistent source of motivation, and encouragement. They’re the ones who have been there to remind me of my potential. The collective energy of our group has been a force to be reckoned with, and I have always been proud to be part of it. 

I have learned so much from this community, and I know that it has been a major factor in forming the person that I am today.

At EIIG I would be able to utilize my organizational and management skills and work with small businesses in high-poverty areas. Furthermore, it would provide me with the opportunity to learn more about the industry and gain hands-on experience. Being a part of this club will allow me to connect with like-minded individuals to improve my networking and learn from people who have made great strides in this organization. With the network of alumni and faculty, I would have access to through being a part of EIIG, I would be able to connect to subject experts in our community to further my own goals while creating a space for others to learn and practice their skills as well. I also believe that the tools I gain from this organization will help me form long-lasting and positive relationships in the future. Overall EIIG would be another step towards my goal of making a positive impact on the community that I am surrounded by. ","A project that I worked on was a part of a program called Global Encounters. I was put into a team of nine members including myself and our project was on the Children’s Orphanage in Mombasa, Kenya. The children identified the library as the room that needs the most help as it had grown very old over the years and noticed that renovations were required. We heard their concerns and what they wanted in this room. Our next step included putting up posters and other basic academic resources all over the library. This was done by making interactive posters with the children along with basic math resources (i.e., multiplication tables, etc.) and other such resources. We then reached out to the Aga Khan Academy to help us get books that were donated to be given to this organization. We further established a relationship with the Academy and Orphanage so that there can be a continuous flow of books, nonacademic and academic books. We also made a sheet of students who volunteered to be in charge of the library maintenance on a weekly basis. We helped teach some of the senior children basics of the computer so they could teach the younger children when they grew a little older. The two reasons I am very passionate about this project is first because we made a very sustainable project that can help future generations and secondly because we gave the power back into the hands of the children so they can run this room by themselves without any outside help.","I recently started a club at Emory known as the “Data Interpreters Association”. The entire idea of the club and its origins required a lot of creativity and problem-solving skills. I initially had to think of more creative ways to market the club. We followed the regular protocol to market it on social media and through the use of flyers. However, I realized that to be creative we should be marketing directly in classes, and it helped us expand our reach that way to the QSS community. Moreover, with this club, we had to think of different avenues of focus which draw different audiences. We then decided to work with small non-profit organizations to help them with their data. This would help the non-profit as well as our members to gain professional experience. Therefore, a lot of creative solutions were required so that my team and I could achieve the results we wanted.  ","A community that has shaped part of my identity is the one I grew up in. I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan where there was a strong sense of community. Growing up there taught me the importance of family, friendship, but most importantly giving back to the community. I learned the value of hard work and the importance of helping others through my father who was constantly involved in volunteer work and motivated me to get more involved. I started getting more involved in volunteer work such as my work in Kenya and a scholarship office which instilled in me a strong sense of responsibility towards others and my community. The values of kindness, generosity, and support that I learned in my community have stayed with me throughout my life and continue to shape who I am as a person today.

I have experienced firsthand the effect the lack of financial and coaching resources can have on one's development. I would like to see systematic change, and it is starting here at EIIG, and I want to be a part of it. I know that by joining this club, I will have the opportunity to further my learning about the due diligence required to ensure long and fruitful partnerships, asses actionable improvements in business, and aid in implementing the suggested improvements. Additionally, there will be opportunities to research emerging technologies, ESG standards, and data collection approaches for entrepreneurs. At the end of my time with EIIG, I hope I will have impacted entrepreneurs by learning how to better asses and coach them through ideating, improving their processes, and implementing new differentiating qualities of their businesses. ","Taking a week away from my internship this past summer was a hard decision. Still, when I was offered an opportunity to help mentor younger children, I immediately spoke to my boss, who encouraged me to participate as a coach. This was a significant opportunity because I knew there was a need for volunteers, and I had experience in business case studies. During my experience,  I provided guidance and support to middle school students as they navigated the ideation, prototyping, and pitching phase of their business plans. My experience winning past case studies, such as the Kaiser Permanente 180 degrees competition, helped me guide my students to identify and validate their business ideas, create prototypes, and develop compelling pitches for potential investors. The students were able to gain valuable hands-on experience in the process of creating and launching a business. Through my passion for teaching and helping others grow personally and professionally, they learned essential skills such as problem-solving, teamwork, and communication, which will serve them well in their future careers. ","Last summer, I served as a strategic procurement intern for Mohawk Industries. While working for them, I was tasked to improve the accuracy of their material data collection, decrease excess inventory, and overall increase streamlining of their material reacquisition process. Knowing that their current process was inefficient, I tasked myself to create and implement shelf templates that would be standardized across their storerooms serving as coordinates to locate and record material usage. The improvement was simple yet effective. The results were astonishing; combined across the two storerooms where I helped implement the templates, I created $180,000 of data visibility for future automation efforts to further reduce reacquiring materials inefficiencies. ","Growing up in a low-income community, I faced many challenges and obstacles. Despite the difficulties, I have always believed in the power of education and hard work to overcome them. With determination, the proper financial assistance, mentorship, and a network, anyone can overcome the obstacles of being from underrepresented and income communities. For these reasons, I value putting myself in uncomfortable situations of learning, dedicating myself to my studies, and giving back the knowledge I am accumulating. By doing this, I can create better opportunities for others. ",,3.1875,0.424,-0.22,

As I flipped through my high school yearbook on the last day of virtual class, I was struck by the statistic that only 50 percent of my grade had enrolled in higher education. Many of my friends were unable to pursue further education due to financial constraints and the lack of opportunities in our dilapidated hometown. Also, most of the students who sought higher education enrolled in schools that were far from our home. This realization made me determined to use my education and resources to make a difference in my community. Instead of leaving it behind for something better, I want to work towards creating a sense of community and belonging in my hometown. I want to be a role model for my peers and show them that with hard work and determination, they too can achieve their dreams and make a difference in their community. My goal is to provide support and opportunities for others to succeed, just as my community did for me. If I were to be a member at the EIIG, I would be able to gain knowledge and skills to make a positive impact in my hometown. I am confident that my participation in the EIIG will be a stepping stone towards achieving my personal and professional goals, and I am committed to making the most of this opportunity.","One thing that always bothered me when I listened to music was the quality of the speaker. I tried numerous products from famous companies such as Bose and JBL, but none of them satisfied me. Since the commercially available speakers were not up to my standards, I decided to take matters into my own hands and build one for my own. With a blueprint in hand, I ordered parts from China, and began this small project in the garage. 
Months of soldering, woodworking, and mathematics went into the speaker, and it slowly but surely began to take shape. After much trial and error, my speaker was nearly complete. For the finishing touches, I carefully trimmed the edges and polished the sides so smooth the wood almost felt like glass. I then took a step back and admired my work. For this small speaker, I had utilized all the different skills that I had learned throughout my life: mathematics from school, Autocad from Engineering Club, woodworking from my guitar job.
Though these skills were seemingly disparate, I was able to bridge the gap and create a product that worked in harmony. This project not only gave me the satisfaction of creating something of my own, but it also instilled a sense of confidence in my abilities. The speaker not only served as an impressive piece of technology, but also as a symbol of my own potential and the power of combining diverse skills to achieve something truly special.","Whenever I am hit with a complex problem that I am struggling to solve, I head to the nearest Walgreens to buy a pack of Crayola chalks. I have found that by visualizing the problem and drawing it out on our family's driveway, it becomes more tangible and easier for me to understand. Like a cartographer, I map out the problem in the center of the driveway and create a web-like structure around it filled with ideas, some incomplete, while others leading to possible solutions. This method of problem-solving allows me to make the problem feel ""real"" to me, and it gives me the opportunity to stand above it, figuratively and literally, consider the problem from different angles, and find new perspectives that I may have overlooked before. Though the method may look childish, it has proven to be effective for myself time and time again.","As a student musician, I have always been surrounded by other musicians. One thing that has always amazed me is how different musicians can make the same instrument sound so unique, as if they were molding it like playdough. I once asked one of my music mentors, Jeff, how to become a successful musician. He replied, “You can't become a successful musician just by mastering chords or music theory. To truly make an instrument your own, you have to add a little bit of ‘you’ to it.” This could be a skill, a flair, or even a trick that gets the crowd excited. But whatever it is, I knew I had to find a way to make it truly mine. Since then, whenever I am learning something new, I always find a way to create a method that works for me while incorporating my own unique touch into it.",,3.1666666666666665,0.428,-0.117,
2023-01-27 13:54:35.260,R,,Finance,Sophomore,Asian,Both,"I believe that my interest in joining EIIG comes from the two most crucial aspects of EIIG: the value investments and the community impact. 

As a student majoring in finance, I consider investing as part of my most important life pursuits. Under the influence of my parents, I learned how to conduct the valuation of companies, and how to determine the growth potential and defaulting risk. I have put this knowledge into practice by solving key financial problems and industrial analysis during my summer internship at HSBC holdings, and by investing in stocks and other securities to cultivate my skills in determining the financial stability of companies. EIIG is a compact platform where I can trade my investing knowledge and skills with like-minded individuals and manage assets.

Apart from the investment perspective, the community impact that EIIG generates is equally valuable. In a world where the barriers to entry in many industries are becoming gradually higher due to the permeation of large corporations, it is important that small firms from local communities are able to gain opportunities to grow. My previous experience in Project V and Everview consulting clubs both involves serving the betterment of nonprofits and small firms, which industries range from health to food security. I'm confident that my assets in working with similar clients can be well applied to EIIG's clients.
","The most impactful project which I was passionate about was fundraising for Operation Smile, an international nonprofit that dedicates to helping children with inborn cleft palate. It's a project that I engaged in for 3 years during middle school and high school. I and my friend would set up charity booths, design our own equipment, and facilitate channels of donation. We gave multiple speeches and presentations to mostly middle-class audiences, to provide the scope of the physical suffering and discrimination toward these children, and explain the mitigation of that suffering with more financial equality. In these speeches, I used both quantitative data and pathos delivery to fully convey the message. Many of our audiences are convinced by the importance of community awareness, so many of them choose to donate. Apart from the monetary value I produced(I managed to generate more than $5,000 over multiple fundraising events) for Operation Smile, I found myself gaining self-worth and passion every time I embark on events that expands community betterment and reduces societal discrimination.","Creative thinking to me is using differential knowledge and lenses of observation to generate an out-of-the-box methodology to resolve a task.  I was the financial officer for a student tech media startup in high school, and I was in charge of preparing the pitch in front of our potential investors. The difficulty to communicate our value proposition(tech, media, younger generation) toward our 60-year-old investor trapped me. After brainstorming, I began to inject my economic logic into the pitching equation. I included many benefits brought to traditional industries by the tech industries and the Internet. By explaining how an important emerging industry will have multiplying effects on the output of value since the industries and markets are highly connected, the investor was eventually convinced that our startup had a viable proposition and strategy. We eventually received $15,000 in funds. I believe it is my creative thinking that led to this success.","My Chinese-American identity is one that shapes me personally the most. As I have lived in both countries for a decent amount of my life, I'm able to speak both English and Mandarin fluently and professionally. I believe that my personal experience in both countries over the many years has offered me a profound understanding of the two countries' economic structures, political landscapes, and societal dynamics. It's a prominent global vision highly useful in investing. Culture-wise, I was involved in many parts of the Chinese culture which I found essential to my personal growth. I practice Chinese calligraphy since eight and was invited to many Emory Chinese-American events to demonstrate my calligraphy skills and write couplets. Chinese festivals and cuisines are also important to me, and I enjoy the dedication and connection to culture as I feel a sense of personal belonging. ",,3.1500000000000004,0.421,-0.185,
2023-01-27 13:52:55.760,R,,Business and Economics,Sophomore,Hispanic or Latino,Both,"Mathematics has always been the subject that most interested me throughout the course of my education. It is grounded on objectivity, with countless rules and formulas. Despite these restrictions, there is much room for interpretation and nuance. Solving the problem is the ultimate goal, but there is an entire process to go through before that is achieved. It can be complicated, long, and infuriating, but the feeling of satisfaction I felt after struggling to solve certain problems made it all worth it. Similarly, this is what gravitates me towards EIIG.

EIIG is the organization where I can develop my professional skills for the future, but more importantly, do so while helping out local business owners in the Atlanta community. The work being done is intense, but I realized after attending the interest meetings that it does not take away from the organization’s welcoming and humanitarian nature. The members of the organization form a group of individuals who not only deeply care about the work they do but also about the people they work with. The three-year consulting commitment made to the clients shows the organization’s dedication to develop a genuine personal relationship with each of their clients. This aspect of EIIG is most enticing, and the opportunity to further develop technical skills—communication, organization, teamwork, critical thinking—through the due diligence process will aid in building myself up professionally. I can leverage my dedication to the organization to ensure that the clients and I gain as much from my involvement as possible.","	One activity that I was involved in was a volunteering program that my middle school hosted during the summers for underprivileged students. Similar to the work that Emory Impact Investing Group is doing to bridge the micro-business gap affected by redlining, my middle school aimed to bridge the gap in education for students in New York City. I worked with students ranging from second to sixth grade, whether it was about the classes they were in, issues they had with friends, and anything in between. As a high schooler at the time, I wished to share with them the experiences I had when I was their age in hopes of helping them overcome any challenges they were facing. I spent three summers in a row working with these students, seeing many of them every year and growing close with them. One of the most rewarding aspects was seeing the ways in which the students I worked with changed over the years, becoming more and more engrossed in their studies and doing productive work for their futures. Additionally, I could see that they developed friendships between each other, which helped them enjoy the program more and more. It was gratifying to see these young students building constructive habits, and knowing I could make a difference made me more motivated to continue helping them. This experience inspires me to keep helping people around me, whether it be with my closest friends or a larger community that I am a part of.","For as long as I can remember, sports have been a huge part of my life. As I get older, I have less time to keep doing the sports that I love, oftentimes spending months on end without playing soccer, tennis, or squash. The lack of sports in my life and the ever-growing feeling of stress has clouded my mental health. Last year, I developed a strong interest in rock climbing. At first, it filled the void of the sports I no longer participated in, but I realized it has a more important purpose. It allows me to completely separate myself from my daily life. There is a feeling of zen I feel while rock climbing, where my only focus is to complete the boulder problems and move on, which has helped me through the hard times I have faced throughout college thus far.","The community I had while living in Santiago, Chile, has shaped a large part of my identity. Since Chile is a very small country, all of my family—cousins, aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc—lived in Santiago. Some of my cousins even lived down the street from us, so we would see them every day. No matter where we were, more family joined us, furthering the importance that these people had in my life. Family is an integral part of any culture, but being with my family so often created an atmosphere that allowed me to be with the people I loved most during one of the most fundamental stages of my development. Due to the welcoming nature of family, and because I experienced it so much, I became attached to it. It gave me a sense of security, and now I try to replicate it wherever I am.",,3.15,0.418,-0.232,

I have always been one who has been engaged with smaller firms develop products through my initiative with Daily Dump to design a soil testing kit. Having grown up in India, I also align with EIIG’s mission of bridging the financial gap between smaller firms and the bank. In India, the smaller businesses hire the most number of people after agriculture making this a vital sector of the economy. But yet many of those small businesses face financial struggles. Hence through EIIG I hope to help small businesses that can help them thrive and in turn have an impact on society. 

With more than 1 million small business that operate in Georgia, I aim to build my network and relationship while being part of EIIG. When I went for the Bagel and Coffee Chat, I understood one thing that EIIG is just not a club, it's a family. Members look after each other and come from various backgrounds and interests. Through EIIG’s community, I know that although I may be a freshman the learning curve will never be too steep, as there will always be someone there to guide and coach me! 
","The activity that I was involved in high school a lot was Community Service. Throughout my high school, I had made it a point to fight environmental issues that harmed my city of Bangalore. Bangalore was once called the “garden city” of India. It had supposedly around 1,000 lakes before. However there are only 80 lakes left and most of the lakes suffering from water pollution. In fact in 2018, the Bellandur lake, a lake in my neighbourhood caught fire. This drove me to action. To mitigate this problem from happening again, I helped fundraise 15 lakhs INR to help a think tank from Bangalore clean the Devanahalli lake, a lake that was also suffering from water pollution. Furthermore I have also developed a soil testing kit with a start up in Bangalore that would be able to measure the water as well as nutrient concentration and worked on a tree plantation in a barren part of Bangalore. I have also worked on creating awareness for the detrimental effects of the Trans Mountain Pipeline in the Pacific Northwest. Throughout my life I have tried to create social impact wherever I go beat it in Bangalore or even in Seattle, a city I visited during the summer. I think the greatest satisfaction of community service is seeing the positive effects of your work.  For this reason, I am to join EIIG so that I can make a positive change in the local communities of my “new” hometown Atlanta!","One of the challenges I faced as a kid was I had a speech delay and was very shy to talk. I would always hesitate to make contact with anyone.  However I knew this would become a major problem in the future as one must be social in order to network with individuals. Hence I reluctantly joined Model United Nations in High School. For a kid that was not social, the world of Model United Nations (MUN) seemed like a battleground where people were screaming to grab people’s attentions. A rather terrifying sight for introverts! However I did not want to give up as this would be the best way for me to develop my speaking skills. Through MUN, I have been able to tackle my stage fright creatively as now I do not fear people’s judgements and have also learnt important leadership and writing skills because of MUN. 
","Being a Bengali is a pleasure. We are known for our talkative nature .To the point that the word “adda” (meaning colloquial discussion) is used interchangeably when describing a Bengali. We pride ourselves on being “intellectual” and well read. We take pride in the so-called “literary heroes’’ of India: Rabindranath Tagore and Satyajit Ray. But there is something that stands out our love for food. We love sweets and of course fish, a staple in Bengali diet. But being part of this community isn't always a gift: you are subject to discussions of teachers calling you the “talkative bunch” or friends questioning how fish can be considered a staple food. In hindsight, my love for travelling and definitely film is through my cultural background.

Despite having limited knowledge of business in high school, I often talked to friends about potential stocks to buy. With these same friends, I started a tutoring website with them to give back to the community. 

My Emory journey thus far has allowed me to narrow down my interests through taking classes and attending club activities. My first semester accounting class taught me the basics of financials as well as how to analyze the profitability of a company. I learned about new industries as a member of RISE and connected well with others who have the same goal of learning. Most importantly, my experience as an EIIG research member has allowed me  to analyze the Atlanta microbusiness community. 

In addition to what I have learned, I am eager to learn more. I want to apply the business and finance concepts I have learned to the real world, and develop a solid knowledge foundation for my future career in finance. I also want to use my knowledge alongside my peers to help the community in any way I can. I believe EIIG is a perfect place for me to achieve my goal.","One activity I have been heavily involved in is tutoring, as it is a mutually beneficial activity that encourages learning, creates trust, fosters friendship, and most importantly builds a stronger community. 

My first and most rewarding experience was at Squash Haven, a community for underprivileged middle school students. As a volunteer there, my favorite moment occurred when a student finally figured out how to solve a difficult problem. His face lit up with excitement. I was filled with joy since I could relate to his moment of realization that I felt during my classes.

During the pandemic, I tutored students who needed help with AP Chinese virtually. Through that experience, I was able to meet a close friend who I bonded with over similar interests such as tennis and video games. I also created a tutoring website with the help of my friends, so we could cover as many subjects as possible in order to help anyone who wanted to learn. 

Tutoring is so important to me because it allows me to give back to the community that has taught me everything I know. Through this process, I am able to develop friendships as well as create learning opportunities for younger students who value the importance of eduction.","One way I was able to express myself creatively was during an application for a research program called HARPs, which needed me to answer questions from a difficult astronomy article. Despite not knowing almost every other word, I was not deterred. I took a slow and methodical approach, researching everything thoroughly. I was eventually able to present my findings through a presentation. Mine stood out from everyone else as it used visual aspects to depict exoplanets, in contrast to others who just answered the questions through speaking.","A community that has shaped who I am is Complex, my freshman dorm at Emory. It has changed my entire view on the college residential experience and reinforced values within me such as kindness, empathy, and friendship.

Entering the first year of college, the living situation was one that made me nervous, as I was uncertain who my roommate would be or the people living around me. My older friends at Emory stated that it would be difficult to find friends early, and that they barely knew anyone in their dorm hall. 

Reflecting back on the past semester, I couldn’t have asked for a better community. I knew all the SAs and RAs and they became mentors I could trust, or close friends.

I also want to join EIIG because I like being challenged and working with other people to achieve common goals. However, the biggest reason why I want to join EIIG is because EIIG enables me to engage with an area of great social impact that I am especially passionate about: small businesses. EIIG assists small businesses, especially those in economically unstable and vulnerable areas, an area of social impact that I want to participate in due to my past connection and experiences with several small businesses. Overall, I want to join EIIG because I know EIIG would be an amazing environment for personal growth and development, as well as forming genuine connections and friendships with others. EIIG provides an outlet for me to make an impact just like the namesake, and that combined with my open mentality makes EIIG the perfect place for me. ","I led a fundraising initiative among the local Asian American Community for Wuhan residents when I was fifteen years old. This was a month before the pandemic struck America, so at the time it was primarily China that was affected by the consequences of Covid-19. I myself organized a candlelight vigil to raise awareness for the victims in Wuhan, and contacted several of my friends to help set up the event in the town center. I helped arrange the delivery and distribution of supplies, candles, and food and drink services to the event. All in all, we raised several thousand dollars and made the local and regional news, helping to spread awareness of the effects of Covid-19 on the Chinese. The experience was important to me because it taught me lessons in how to organize and prepare, how to reach out and put myself out there. The most important thing from this experience however, was how I was able to commit to something greater than myself, be it my friends or fellow Asian Americans in my community or complete strangers halfway across the world, who had never seen my face but would see the aid I gave. ","When my friends and I got trapped in a tight parking space on the Fourth of July, we thought we were done for. Our car had bottlenecked the exit, and the extremely tight space and absence of light all hindered our ability to get out. However, I forced myself to calm down and devised a plan to minimize the risk of crashing. I had everyone except the driver exit the vehicle and position themselves around the car at a safe distance. We all used our flashlights on our phones to provide an area of light and began shouting instructions for the driver (the GPS was old and untrustworthy). With us all providing specific communications and a newfound light source, we became the eyes for such a risky maneuver. We cleared the space without a scratch and found a parking spot further away, but still close enough to watch the fireworks. ","I have been shaped by the community of my hometown Asian American Christian community. My experiences with the church ranged from food drives to soup kitchens, and I was introduced to a variety of small business owning families through the church.. Many of my friends and family were involved in small businesses, and I was impressed by their fortitude and determination in realizing their dreams. However, it was through this bond where I came to see the vulnerability of small businesses, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic which strained a lot of them. Through the help of my church, these small businesses were able to stay afloat in a rough time. It was through these experiences in my church where I developed an understanding of the importance of honesty, compassion, and above all determination. I also developed a passionate support for small businesses and the dreams they aspire to fulfill. ",,3.1125,0.415,-0.205,

Having been involved in Sumba Club - my high school’s non-profit club destined to support an impoverished region in Indonesia - since middle school, I have always been adamant in participating and getting involved in helping certain communities. Being involved in this type of work has always given me a sense of fulfillment as well as given me a new perspective on my everyday life. As a pre-business major I have always been interested in learning about investment and consulting due to the diversity of work. The challenge to find innovative solutions that consulting brings has always been intriguing to me. When delving deeper into the club’s website, its mission of empowering small businesses, particularly in the city of Atlanta attracted me even more. Helping our local Atlanta community through microloans and working hand in hand with real entrepreneurs seems fascinating. I see this club offering me three principal opportunities. Firstly, getting to discover and support a new community (Atlanta) by interacting with local entrepreneurs. Secondly, learning about investment and consulting by being trained by more experienced students. Thirdly, a real-world experience by meeting real people who run real businesses and being exposed to how a business operates. There could not be a more rewarding and valuable experience for a recent high school graduate than to be a part of this team. ","During my internship at the LNB - Ligue Nationale de Basket - France’s “NBA”, I was tasked with conducting a study on the UEFA Euro (soccer) sponsors and how their activations could serve as a benchmark for LNB’s potential sponsors and strategies. This study was a week-long process in which I had to spend hours looking at the competition's sponsors and the original marketing techniques they were using that would translate well in the basketball world. Having been a soccer fanatic since I was 4 years old and an avid basketball viewer, I was completely in my element. The “hours” of research were in reality just being able to delve deeper into the world I was so fascinated about. At the conclusion of my research, I had to write up a paper and formally present the information I had found to my supervisors. My presentation focused on 5 key sponsors and three original activations they had enlisted. This activity was very important to me because it allowed me to use my pre-existing knowledge and passion for a certain industry in order to contribute something that would be of value to the company. Being a soccer fan at heart, I think I gave some key insights and a different perspective on what the LNB could take from the soccer world. ","For years I had tried to convince my long time Karim, to join a running club at my school. However, no matter what health benefits or other reasons I listed to encourage my friend to join he just never seemed either motivated or persuaded enough to finally lace up his shoes. Having taken a few Photoshop courses, I decided to create a short 2 minute  animation in which we can see the ""before running"" - a sluggish, unmotivated and unhealthy Karim, and the after - a clean, more happy, and motivated Karim. The goal of the video being to display how this massive change in lifestyle was all due to joining a small high school running club. In the end, Karim found this animation so hilarious - or he just had pity for me - and decided to join the club. I think changing my approach on how to convince my friend was the key to persuading him. A short comical animation was much more effective than simply listing reasons to join the running club. ","The community that undoubtedly shaped a great part of my identity is the football club that I spent over 8 years with -ES16. Based in Paris, France I joined the club when I was 10 years old. Although I am French I had never lived in France before, so my parents encouraged me to join a club in order to be able to socialize with other french kids. This club would eventually allow me to meet and make my best friends that came from all over France. Having played over 10+ tournaments and hundreds of matches with my teammates I finally felt a part of a real community. My experience as a member of this community taught me the importance of teamwork while battling till the last minute for a goal or leadership when dealing with defeat. This community taught me discipline as I showed up every day on time for training or as I clearly listened to my coach’s instructions. This community helped me foster a sense of pride and resilience as we experienced so many ups and downs over the years. I believe my journey at this club shaped the person I am today through the valuable experiences and lessons I learned. ",,3.083333333333333,0.407,-0.256,
2023-01-27 01:25:20.013,R,,BBA - Finance,Freshman,Asian,Both,"I believe EIIG is the ideal organization for me because I will be able to support EIIG's goal of closing the micro-business gaps in traditionally high-poverty neighborhoods while also strengthening and building my finance/investment knowledge. As I lived in Silicon Valley for the majority of my life, I strive to learn more about how small businesses and investments operate outside of my hometown, such as Atlanta. I wish to expand my knowledge of the processes of investing and working with entrepreneurs while also giving back to my new community in Atlanta. Also, I wish to create new connections and surround myself with like-minded peers who are dedicated to learning the intricacies of investing and growing small businesses. I believe my past experience as an intern at ACVC Partners, a deep-tech venture fund, will help me to learn and adapt to the needed skills for EIIG. During my time at ACVC Partners, I had the privilege to attend the meetings between the board directors and the entrepreneurs and see what goes into evaluating not only the business but the entrepreneur themselves. I fully support EIIG's goal of supporting local communities and wish to be part of a community that challenges each other to grow. ","During the troubling times of COVID-19, a group of friends and I decided to create an organization called Essential Heroes Campaign (EHC), where we set out to give back to our essential workers by raising funds and awareness for our workers. As co-lead of the business committee, I held the responsibility of reaching out to potential donors/investors and formulating plans for crowd-funding. Thanks to our collective efforts, EHC raised a little over $4000, donated 1000 masks and ear savers to overworked nurses at the O’Connor Hospital, contributed to food distributions supporting local restaurants and financially struggling families, and partnered with organizations such as CCAT to support 75 farmworkers with protective equipment. As for me, I was able to take lead for the first time in the community that brought me up. I not only learned to effectively communicate and start networking but also witnessed my community’s power to support each other in times of need — the essence, I believe, of being in a community. ","As a viola teacher for young children, I was often met with noncompliance and attitude that resulted in ineffective and slow lessons. Needing to please the parents to maintain my customers, I created a friendly, competitive game for my students. During the first five minutes of the weekly lessons, each of my students would play the week's assigned scale and see who could win the most points for the most in-tune playing. Over a 4-week period, whoever had the most points would win a $15 Target gift card. Remembering my competitive drive as a kid and my hardships of being engaged throughout continuous music lessons, I strove to incorporate fun and competitive games to keep my students motivated to practice. With these $15 dollar investments, I saw lively students who were eager to win the game, and ultimately maintained all 13 of my customers throughout my 8 months of teaching. ","As a member of Sky Ensemble, a non-profit organization aimed to provide funds and concerts for a senior health center, I not only found purpose in the 8 years of viola playing but also found a sense of community that taught me to be accepting of people for their differences. Walking onto the stage to perform, I was met with a strong sense of medicine and the sight of saline bags and wheelchairs. As I was uncomfortable with my surroundings and the seniors, I would often play the music and leave for the first few weeks. However, after being approached by a senior named Yelena and talking about our shared interest in Pinchas Zukerman, a renowned violist, I slowly mustered up the courage to talk with the seniors after the concerts. The community I formed with the wonderful seniors helped me to find the joy of connecting with others. ",,3.0625,0.401,-0.298,

I love the idea of promoting sustainable growth for smaller-scale entrepreneurs and I'd love to contribute to that process. I have a unique and creative skillset that I believe could contribute to EIIG's goal, and I'm really looking forward to the opportunity to take valuable experiences from the rest of EIIG. As someone who wants to eventually work in the finance or consulting industry, this club would be very helpful in expanding my knowledge in these fields. I'm also currently working on a fashion-related business of my own, so I know a bit about the process beginning entrepreneurs face. While I still have a lot to learn, I'm a very motivated and outgoing person so I will be quick to immerse myself in the club and make the most of it. Most importantly, I'm very excited to make new friends in EIIG that have similar interests to myself!","Most recently, I was very passionate and active in SAC (student activities committee) for the past 1 and 1/2 years at Oxford before graduating. I left with so many amazing friendships and valuable experiences that have helped me both grow as a person and greatly expand my skillset. I was a part of a PR committee, so I was largely in charge of creating plans for advertisements using flyers/GroupMe/instagram and other creative methods. I also had the opportunity to collaborate in planning and setting up events, and then running them. This took a great deal of coordination and teamwork with everyone in the club, and it taught me how to be an effective team leader as we're often working under stressful conditions to make sure everything goes right. I found this to be the most enriching experience during my college career thus far, and now I'm looking to similarly immerse myself in a new club now that I'm at main campus, which I hope will be EIIG.","In high school, I was the co-president of the Amnesty International club which is a human rights-focused club. The problem was we our school struggled with funding, and thus we didn't have much to finance operations for our club. I really wanted to have our club promote actionable change, so I kept brainstorming ways to raise a significant amount of money for events. Ultimately, I maximized the tools I already had by bringing the idea to my Chipotle manager to host a fundraiser that would both generate funds for my club and extra revenue for our Chipotle location. We had a really great turnout and we were able to fund a few human rights speakers to host assemblies at our school and promote discussion on current social and human rights issues.","The LGBT community has been a huge part of finding my sense of self and building my confidence in who I am today. I grew up in an area where there aren't many gay people, so I found it hard to accept being gay and find people I could relate to. But, as I got older, I was able to build really meaningful connections with people similar to myself in the LGBT community which really helped me be secure in myself and become more confident and outgoing as I am too. The whole experience of discovering my identity made me really independent and determined to succeed in spite of any negative experiences that came with it.",,3.0625,0.402,-0.284,

I watched my mom open her own dental office while pregnant with her fifth kid, and I watched my dad quit the job he had and co-found a company where he could do what he was passionate about. Both of my parents owning small businesses and working at a local boutique for four years has solidified my belief that it is very important to support these smaller locally owned businesses in the midst of a culture of chains and department stores. Joining EIIG would give me the chance to not only learn more about investing and gain real-world experience, but it would also help me support something that I am passionate about. ","Freshman year of high school I joined “The Current”, my school's literary magazine. When I walked into the first meeting there were only three people in the room including me. This didn’t come as a surprise since I went to a very preppy school without a strong arts program. However, the three of us were dedicated to publishing the first issue of The Current that the school had seen in three years. The biggest problem was trying to get submissions because while there were many creative people in my school they did not want their work to be published in fear of judgment. Eventually, we put up enough advertisements around the school and an anonymous submission box that we got enough submissions to put together and print the magazine. Every year since then there has been at least one edition of the current, and by my senior year, we had grown from three members to twenty. I am proud of this because expression through visual arts and writing has always been very important to me and I feel as though I succeeded in creating a space where people at my high school now felt comfortable showcasing their creative side.","During my junior year of high school my friend and I decided that we wanted to raise money to donate to an organization that was helping fight climate change. Since I am very passionate about fashion, I created a design inspired by climate change that we then embroidered onto hoodies and sold around school. While we planned on making more designs we decided to stop because we realized the environmental impact of buying the hoodies was more than the profits we donated. However in the future I would love to continue to create designs inspired by different crises and find a way to manufacture them onto hoodies in a more environmentally friendly way. ","Growing up in the Greek community has shaped a large part of my identity. Memories like going to Greek school every Saturday, cooking with my grandmother or big get-togethers at my uncle's house are a huge part of my childhood. Growing up in this community means that I have always been surrounded by constant support and warmth and there is always someone to call if I have a problem. But it also means I have grown up around a group of people with an incredibly strong work ethic that have made countless sacrifices so that I could have the opportunities that I have today. As the oldest of five siblings and all my cousins, I have a responsibility to succeed. Wanting to give back to my family once I graduate college and get a job motivates me to work hard and mirror the work ethic of all those have surrounded me growing up.

2023-01-27 13:34:28.830,R,,Economics and math ,Freshman,Asian,Analyst,"Little things mean a lot – I fully understood what this meant after learning about EIIG.  
 
Personally, giving back to my community is very important as I get a unique sense of purpose by serving those around me and it helps me understand myself and how I fit into my community. I prefer small-scale service, as I have done so throughout high-school, because it helps me gain a more hands-on experience. EIIG will similarly provide a close and warm environment with clients which will help me understand them and their needs to consequently help consult them in the best way I can.  
 
Moreover, my interest in small businesses is very high, such that I started one of my own, WorkIn. This allows me to personally relate with some problems small businesses can face, especially when they have limited funds. EIIG also provides me with a similar platform to do what I love while gaining the sense of satisfaction of positively impacting my community. 
 
Additionally, EIIG’s professional and collaborative approach drives me towards the club – the systematic procedure of researching and then providing loans to businesses. Hearing and understanding the views of likeminded teammates provides a lot of learning in each step along the way. Moreover, having the opportunity to interact with and take guidance from seniors and high profile individuals through EIIG’s panel discussion will equip me with the required skills from a career aspect as well. 
 
I wish to climb up the ladder and leave my mark over my four years at EIIG since I’m very fond of the people and its warm environment. I wish to help close the micro-business gap by helping a new business every semester. ","Being an avid golfer since Grade 7, my club’s caddies have taught me a lot – they’ve been my mentors. Right from correcting my swing, or directing the green’s line, I have learned a lot from them.

The outbreak of COVID-19 impacted their lives significantly. Due to the closing of the club, they had zero income, and faced great difficulties in affording basic living necessities and treatment. The situation of India was only worsening with the two waves and huge shortage of vaccines throughout the country. I couldn’t stop thinking about how my caddies would have been impacted due to the low levels of sanitation in their living areas. Therefore, I decided to act upon it.

I decided to host a video game tournament to raise funds since the only way of connecting was virtual. Harnessing the power of social media marketing, I received 120 registrations. This large number created some challenges like figuring out online payment methods and answering multiple queries simultaneously, but my determination to keep going was strong.

I raised Rs. 25,000 (approximately $350) which used to vaccinate the caddies. After obtaining the required permissions from the club, I reached out to someone organizing a vaccination drive. A big challenge I faced was getting in touch with the caddies and getting their particulars required for registration, but after making numerous phone calls I was able to register them all.

On the vaccination day, we faced unforeseen issues, like the caddies not having the government mandated application to proceed with a vaccination. Therefore, I ensured I downloaded and registered each of them on it through their respective phones. Though the logistics seemed challenging and tedious, seeing them take a step forward towards safety and that I could contribute to their welfare makes me proud.","The experience I gained from three internships helped me identify my career path. However, I realised that due to COVID-19, other students weren’t able to get the same opportunities. To resolve this, I founded WorkIn: a platform that provides internship opportunities to students in over 30 fields. We approached 70 companies and succeeded in connecting 26 students to many.

In an effort to solve a problem, I ameliorated my leadership style, ability to evaluate individuals’ strengths, and tactfully handle critical situations. I also learned how to manage crises within the team and make prompt decisions. When there was a dispute among the marketing team members regarding the poster content, I helped resolve it through an activity and survey. We reached a consensus by reflecting on different facets of our brand and how we wanted to be perceived by our audience. This taught me to be open-minded and reflective in decision making processes. 

Another aspect was providing members with an opportunity for self-growth by refining their leadership and practical skills. Through this process, I developed the salient skill of helping individuals identify their area of expertise and using it to benefit our organization. 

Thus, while trying to resolve a problem around me, I learned a lot about myself and boosted the growth of those in my team. ","Being 6’6” in the Indian community is uncommon. 
 
Whenever I walk in public areas, I encounter hushed whispers and stunned faces. There were times when I didn’t fit in – literally.
 
Knowing this was out of my control, it started a downward spiral within me.
 
My grandmother explained me that I could look at my height as a path of despair or one of optimism. She made me understand that I should feel like a celebrity when people ask to click pictures with me. She highlighted how when someone is angry with me, the uncomfortable angle of looking up dissolves the anger into laughter. Over time, her approach cultivated a sense of positivity within me. 
 
During a trip to Australia, I saw that people there were as tall as me! For the first time, I didn’t feel conscious about myself. I realized that my height is unusual in the Indian community but quite the norm globally.
 
Back in India, the stunned faces didn't change, but my reaction did: I began smiling and embracing the fact that I’m different – I’m unique.  
 
I learned that I can’t control everything about myself except how I deal with it; I have two choices, I can lay low or stand tall. ",,3.0625,0.402,-0.284,

I did and still do tennis coaching privately and I was an assistant coach at a Nike Tennis Camp over the summer for 1 month. Working with all ages to improve both their mindsets and technical skills. Being able to improve someone else has always made me happy. I love working with people to ensure that they improve their lives and I find it very rewarding. With my private coaching, I was able to improve the level of tennis in my neighborhood and even earn some of my students city-level awards in recreational tennis. Others have been able to take their game and thus confidence to a whole new level which helps both on and off the tennis court. Even helping their high school team make it to the state competition. Coaching is more than just tennis knowledge, but also learning how to be a good competitor and embracing hard work because that is the foundation of any success. It is so important to me because growing up I had the technical knowledge of tennis, but never had a guide for my mental approach and a coach I could lean on as a friend. I want to be the person who someone can rely on and know that I am supporting them as much as I can. I truly care about improvement both for my students and myself, and each goes hand in hand. 
","My hobbies also encompass 3-D printing and airsoft. Anyone who has done it knows that many problems can occur at any step of the process. I was trying to make a part that clips onto my belt and holsters. The specific problem that I had was that I had the holster part printed out and assembled, but it was never meant to go on a molle (attachment system)  belt and so there were no molle clips readily printable. To get the design I needed the holster to attach to my belt I took an existing file from another molle clip design and cut, reshaped, and personalized using CAD software to perfectly fit my holster. It took many trials and errors, but I was able to solve the problem of attaching my holster to my belt. So far the part has served me well for 2 years. 

","My life revolved around tennis my entire childhood and the community of USTA national tournament players have shaped me as a person the most in my opinion. I would see the same competition every week and try to beat them every time. However, it has taught me many valuable lessons in humility, belief in oneself, and the power of a good mindset. Even though there was so much on the line every week at these tournaments everyone remained friends. The foundation of this was treating others with mutual respect.  Also comparing yourself to others only leads to constant stress. The only way to succeed in a hyper-competitive environment is to work hard and trust yourself and your path. This community has shown me the aspects of high-performance people and also how to enjoy and thrive in that environment. Even though we were all opponents, we were friends first.

Years later, Springs became my second home. But that feeling of loneliness still comes up sometimes. This is especially true when I notice the self-separation between international boarders and day students, or when I bump up against cultural barriers.

Studying at a liberal institution in Alabama not only shaped my unique understanding of bridging cultural gaps, but also raised my social awareness. From advocating for lgbtq+ rights in local Birmingham to launching a nationwide fundraise for purchasing masks in China when covid just arrived, I managed to do it all thanks to the support of my own community, which gave me the confidence to lead the larger community beyond my own circle.

EIIG's mission to support social entrepreneurship in underserved communities resonated with my desire, while providing me with a valuable opportunity to get into consulting through the most practical way of doing things: experiencing firsthand what is really at stake. Also, I'm really drawn to EIIG's culture - its values of authenticity, empathy and diversity - not only because those are what I value most, but because I believe finding the right places and missions is the key to flourishing.","When Covid-19 hit mainland China, I resolved to offer some efforts so that I initiated a fundraising for hospital supplies with my friends across schools. When the pandemic permeated to my city, I prepared as quickly as possible to initiate a Covid-19 fundraiser with my friends across the United States and China.

The progress of proactively leading the initiative could be no less challenging. No matter it was managing the social media groups, assigning tasks, designing posters for promotion, contacting hospitals or finding resources for transportation, my friends and I spent days and nights going through every detail. It was embracing the actual uneasiness indeed. But every night when I finished the day’s work, I knew we were doing better. 

On the night finishing the last financial report of the project, I turned off the computer and thought to myself, “We made it.” A total of $37k was raised to purchase medical supplies for hospitals in China within 2 months after the outbreak. But what was not finished was what followed: a new chapter. There, more uneasiness is waiting for me to discover and embrace.","“What’s your opinion on the recent anti-transgender sports bill signed by the Alabama governor?”

“It is undoubtedly an unreasonable one based on biased misinformation and political machination.”

Fury and astonishment aside, this question prompted me into a deeper contemplation over the political roots for this preposterous legislation, the discrimination against an already vulnerable group as well as the paradoxical social condition thwarting progress towards a diverse society. 

As a typical ENTP, I have always been delighted in mental sparring, when challenges invariably render me an exhilaration of reflection, inviting me into an opposite perspective to scrutinize my stance. 

I believe that creativity is rooted in understanding the pros and cons of an issue and grows freely from constant debate and rebuttal.","I had a crush on a girl when I was 14. Growing up in a conservative society, the realization of my identity brought me fear, self-doubt, self-reconciliation, and empathy. Accepting who I am and coming out to those around me was a terrifying experience. Although my parents eventually came to accept my identity, they still wanted me not to disclose my sexuality to the surrounding social circle, believing that this unconventional trait would bring me stigma from the broader society. 

They were not wrong. The explicit and implicit social critique all deepened my self-doubt. This inner struggle finally came to an end when I reveled in the liberal ambiance at my high school. From joining the GSA and advocating for lgbtq+ activism - where I developed a more eclectic and confident self - to openly debating democracy versus communism in my Global Issues class, I learned the freedom and courage of self-expression.",,3.0,0.388,-0.355,

I conducted market research about the market the company occupied, future market projections, and how they could potentially expand their brand name and recognition. I then would compose Powerpoint presentations and present them to the owner of the company. This experience was incredibly rewarding as I not only worked to improve my professionalism, presentational skills, and consulting knowledge, but I tangibly experienced how my advice could aid a small business in need.

I view Emory Impact Investing Group as a fantastic resource to potentially continue my work of giving back to small businesses in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. I can once again dedicate myself to providing professional-level market research, and consulting services that pay off in tangible and rewarding ways for both the small business and members of the club. Another differentiating factor of Emory Impact Investing is something I was unable to provide, helping the company by supplying and allocating capital where they otherwise would not have the opportunity to receive such aid. The mission of Emory Impact Investing Group and the culture of devoting oneself to the success of a small business while gaining an opportunity to grow professionally is a community where I would feel very at home and surround by like-minded individuals who are passionate about giving back to the Atlanta community and the success of small businesses.","The transition to college from high school was one that I anticipated being quite difficult given that I came from a small school in Minnesota. I applied and was accepted to the Ignite Leadership Program as a way to develop my leadership skills before college. I ended up finding the program extremely rewarding. Before my sophomore year of college, I wanted to provide this experience for the incoming class of freshman. In an effort to continue this tradition, I competed with over 120 applicants, and was one of six Oxford College Ignite Leaders in the fall of 2022.

I then had twenty minutes to develop and print handouts of an entire Powerpoint Presentation that would fill the space of one hour. I expressed myself creatively by collaborating with my fellow employees and implementing my public speaking skills in order to create speaker notes and slides that would be useful for the presenter in addition to the creating effective cohesion and transition between the slides to create a consistently engaging and useful with the presentation which became a rousing success.","The community that has been the most formative in my development at Emory University has been Oxford College's Organization of Latinos Americanos. Growing up without my grandparents my ties to my heritage were severed. When I came to Oxford College one of the values that I wanted to connect with and expand upon was diversity. I applied and was accepted to the Organization of Latinos Americanos executive board as a first year student. Through event planning, serving on committees, and eventually rising to a senior executive board position, I bonded with my fellow executive board members through an immersive cultural experience. I was able to gain a sense of community with people who shared my heritage through a part of my identity that once felt isolated, and then mentor incoming club members to pass along the tradition of celebrating diversity and Latin American culture at Emory.

I support EIIG's goal of closing the micro-business gap since it will ultimately bring about significant change and boost the number of prosperous enterprises. We can encourage innovation and growth in industries that are essential to sustainable development by assisting these kinds of businesses, and we can also contribute to beneficial social and environmental change. EIIG is advantageous in that it enables students like us to make investments that are consistent with our principles and have a positive influence on the environment or society. Additionally, as the demand for impact investing rises, more money is being drawn to initiatives that are both socially and ecologically beneficial and have the potential to have a wider, positive influence on the globe. 

I'm also interested in joining EIIG because of the extensive networking opportunities I'll have. I may gain insight into the appropriate elective classes to take, how to approach the interview process, and the highs and lows of the work by speaking with Emory students who have interned at various finance businesses. I have a never-ending desire to study, and EIIG's learning tools will enable me to do so while also equipping me with the information and abilities I need to pursue a career in finance. Finally, EIIG may provide students interested in impact investing a sense of community and belonging, enabling us to interact with like-minded people and forge connections.","I established Utopia ESG Fund, a student-run micro-investment firm, with the goal of demonstrating that money can be utilized productively without sacrificing the common good. The mission of the fund is to make investments in businesses with global socioeconomic and sustainability goals. But I'm not acting alone in this endeavor; I've put together a fantastic team of five other students who share my commitment to this goal.

The chief information officer's job is less about choosing stocks and more about making sure the company functions like an efficient machine, with each component contributing to the whole. First, I developed a list of key principles after considering everyone's opinion. These values serve as a daily reminder of why we are undertaking this. In order to avoid opaqueness and secrecy, I also included the usage of technological solutions that were collaborative in nature (like Google Docs). Thirdly, I instituted required weekly check-ins where each participant was urged to offer constructive criticism to others, encouraging contemplation and development.

I firmly believe that businesses can only flourish when the environment supports open communication and unrestricted expression. My life's work is to safeguard these circumstances when they exist and to create them when they don't.","When the Indian government implemented ""demonetization,"" the bulk of the currency in circulation changed from legal tender to illegal tender at the stroke of midnight. This meant that the following day, since the bus conductor wouldn't accept the old banknotes I had in my wallet, I would have to walk five miles to school. This, however, paled in significance in contrast to what awaited the millions of daily wage workers who had previously earned, saved, and spent their money in cash that were now worthless pieces of paper. My jaw dropped at the economic policy's broad reach, despite the fact that it was extremely detrimental in this instance.

I started working with my gated community's treasurer because I didn't want to wait another year to start learning the ins and outs of creating effective regulations. Like a government that spends money on public projects every year, our community also spends money on things like roads, water supplies, member welfare, and cleanliness. I specified the annual budget and consequent fees (akin to taxes) to be collected from each family while optimizing for the good of the public. The redistribution of spending was the main focal point of my policy recommendation. The community was able to develop a version of a senior care facility and expand an already successful childcare center by reducing spending on activities done only for aesthetic reasons, such as the biannual painting of community-owned buildings.","There is just one hill in the center of my hometown in India (tekdi in Marathi). Since the tekdi has come to be associated with the city, hiking has become a custom that is passed down from one generation to the next. The hill is a blank canvas that gives each person the opportunity to create their own particular tale. As a regular visitor, I made genuine personal relationships with Raja, 77, who studied the flora, Aditi, 23, who arranged meetings for pet owners, Fatimah, 51, who took photographs of the peacocks, and myself, 18, who rode a mountain bike around the challenging trails. Despite the fact that our routes had diverged, we all ended up on the hill, where we felt a sense of community.

Since the tekdi gave us so much joy, as it did for generations before us, we tekdi-goers felt obligated to make sure that this experience endures for all ensuing generations. However, the municipality's plan to destroy it for the rapid transit project put our objective in danger. At that point, our community stepped up to the plate and fervently pursued our shared goal. Age, ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic class inequalities were set aside as demonstrating and spreading awareness took center stage. We made sure our home stayed where it is for years to come. 

The hill transformed into a place for expression and interaction without bias. It inspired me to take cooperative action, widen my perspective, and reconcile diverse lives and cultures.",,2.9375,0.378,-0.384,
2023-01-27 13:59:15.213,R,,"Business, Economics",Sophomore,Asian,Both,"I want to join EIIG as it aligns with my interest in helping the community. During high school and college, I have been trying to serve an impact on many different communities on and outside of campus. Through these opportunities, I realized the difficulties each of them is going through, and anyone who can help even a bit can lead to significant support to the community and take a role as an essential member of them. Being persistent when working for my communities, my team and I were able to triumph through many challenges we faced and helped out many others who believed in us. At EIIG, I will get more opportunities to work with a more diverse group of customers with more problems than I previously encountered. Together with my team, we will develop well-rounded solutions to help businesses achieve their goals.

To continue, I believe I have the qualities to become a contributing member of EIIG, being persistent, hardworking, and understanding toward others. In the future, I will work with different businesses and organizations, and being a persistent and hardworking team member who never gives up on difficulties will help me and my team to overcome the tasks we have at hand. In addition, supporting team members struggling with work can help create a more friendly and collaborative working environment. At EIIG, I can continue to serve the team and community with these qualities, ultimately helping me analyze the businesses and deliver the best advice the organization aspires.","Photography is an activity that I picked up starting college. It all started as a fun photoshoot my friend did for me. After the photoshoot, I remembered the joy and excitement I had when looking over the pictures. I wanted to know if I could use photography to give other people the same reaction I had. So, I picked up my mom's old camera and started my photography journey. Over the year, I took thousands of amazing pictures for friends, places, and things I enjoy; however, I wasn't expecting to impact the Emory community with photography.

During the second semester of my freshmen year, I was invited by CUSO as their photographer for the Chinese Culture Night event. I was nervous to photoshoot the event since it was my first time doing event photography; yet, the pictures came out better than I expected, and CUSO liked the photos as well. I realized I could capture the precious moments of Emory students enjoying their time on campus with my camera and make others happy. Since then, I have participated in more school-related photoshoot events. For instance, I teamed with Memory Studios to photoshoot the Emory homecoming tailgate party. We took great photos at the event, and Emory's Instagram page even used our pictures. Seeing thousands of people witnessing the joy of Emory students made me realize how much of an impact my photography can make, and I want to keep positively impacting the Emory community in the future. ","To me, expressing myself creatively is more than just using words and actions; rather, putting myself into other people's shoes to better understand them, present my solution, and solve the problem. For example, I worked as a deli worker at a grocery store over the summer; there were times when we encountered customers who were first-timers to our store. When assigned to help customers who don't know what they want, I would begin with warm greetings and engage in small talk to make them feel comfortable. Then, as I talked to the customers, I would make personalized product recommendations based on what I learned from them and offer new products based on their feedback. Interacting with different customers over the summer made me realize the importance of learning about other people's preferences before attempting to solve the problem, offering my suggestions, and creating a well-rounded solution.","Tennis played a significant role in my life; without tennis, I don't know where I would be in life. Tennis taught me persistence and to find my inner stability. There were many times I would feel terrible about myself and think of quitting tennis after I lost a game badly. But I soon realized that quitting is never the right choice. The only way I can satisfy myself is to keep improving and defeat my opponent next time with more practice and experience. Going into high school, I joined the school tennis team and became the team captain, being responsible by taking care of my teammates, encouraging and critiquing after matches, and practicing with them during my free time. Being the captain made me realize that tennis is not merely an individual sport; it is a collective team effort where we celebrate, encourage, and improve together as our little community.",,2.9375,0.377,-0.391,
2023-01-27 13:06:02.072,R,,BBA/Econ,Freshman,Asian,Both,"	From a young age, I’ve been passionate about business and serving my community. I was a member of my county’s youth advisory board. I also founded PillCura, which helped prevent addiction too opioids. I was passionate about PillCura not about the potential profits, but the potential lives that could be saved. 
	I wish to continue to serve the community and I believe Emory Impact Investing offers the best pathway forward. Helping small businesses in Atlanta that employ and serve the community would be one of the best ways for me to have an impact. I know from my time serving on my county’s youth advisory board that many entrepreneurs from underserved communities often are denied access to resources needed to grow their companies. After attending the information session, I felt that EIIG’s approach to the problem was perfectly suited. Not only does EIIG provide aid, they also consult with the companies to help them. I have always believed simply providing money doesn’t help remedy issues; skills need to be imparted to have a true impact. All of these factors have led me to want to join EIIG.","	One activity that I was very passionate about was the Somerset County Youth Advisory Board. My county in the past had launched programs targeted at youth but often faced difficulties making sure the program connected with them. This led to the Somerset County Youth Advisory Board being founded. The advisory board was made of teenagers from across the county who provided feedback on potential programs. This feedback helped increase the effectiveness of the programs.
	I joined the advisory board before my sophomore year as I wanted to have a larger impact on my community. One of my fondest memories from my time on the board happened just a few months after I joined. Our governor had convened a panel of experts to recommend if New Jersey should ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes. I, like other members of the board, had seen the prevalence of e-cigarettes. When the panel held an event where the public could testify, we knew we had to go. The board organized a trip to Trenton to testify. Some of my board members and I testified how we saw our classmates become addicted to flavored e-cigarettes and asked them to ban the sale of them. A few weeks later the panel advised Governor Murphy to ban them. This event was important to me as it was the first time I played a role, albeit a small one, in helping my community.  ","	One way I creatively expressed myself to solve a problem was founding PillCura. In 7th grade, I first heard about the opioid crisis that was plaguing the country. I did some more research on the issue and I learned the majority of people who had become addicted to opioids had been initially prescribed opioid painkillers. However, many took too many pills at once or took their medication too often, leading to addiction. I also noticed that most solutions at the time, such as rehab, were focused on treating but not preventing addiction. This inspired me to found PillCura, which produced a regulated pill dispenser that only gave the patient’s medication when it was the time and gave the right amount of pills. This would help prevent addiction, saving lives. ","	I’m a member of the makerspace community. When I first started  PillCura, I worked to build a prototype pill dispenser. To build the dispenser I learned various STEM concepts and applied them. The application of these skills to build physical devices is one of the hallmarks of the makerspace community. Members of my community usually learn concepts to build projects, like it was in my case.
	Members of the makerspace community are on my school’s robotic team and helped me improve my technical knowledge. For example, when I built my first prototype, I used a pre-built acrylic cylinder as the outer shell. However I faced difficulties when modifying it as the shell would break easily. I consulted with two friends on the team, asking for suggestions on any alternatives. They suggested using a 3D printer for the shell. This allowed me to build a compact dispenser and create custom parts.",,2.925,0.375,-0.396,
2023-01-27 13:56:57.694,R,,Economics and Mathematics,Freshman,Asian,Analyst,"EIIG and I are a match made in heaven and this is why… As you’ll read in the following essay, I started an organization, TeachMyMoney, to combat financially illiteracy among the youth. My work with TeachMyMoney gave me a special appreciation for how low-income, often minority, individuals can use entrepreneurship to build generational wealth and exit the poverty cycle. But knowledge about running a business doesn’t appear out of thin air. Like financial illiteracy, instruction is immensely necessary. TeachMyMoney and EIIG share the same goal with different approaches. Becoming a part of EIIG will allow me to continue to utilize my experience in teaching financial literacy to impact my community and help businesses establish financial stability.

But, there’s certainly another aspect to this match… During my short stay at Emory, Atlanta’s become my home. And similarly with TeachMyMoney, I strived to find a way to make an impact. One way in which I found this was through Consult Your Community. Through my engagement, The Kai Garden, I’ve found an outlet to actively engage in the Atlanta small business community and engage my analytical skills. However, there are certain aspects of EIIG that better cater to my needs. I found that a semester long engagement isn’t the most conducive for long term impact. Additionally, financial skills like developing models are rarely used in scopes. EIIG not only follows the whole business process but would allow me to learn and use the finance skills I crave.","In high school, as a part of my AP Research class, I chose to research financial literacy in my home state of Tennessee by conducting a financial literacy test. I found that Tennesseans are 17 percent less financially literate than the national average, with young age groups and people of color particularly lagging.
Through my research, I learned about how financial literacy impacts every part of a person's life. For example, a financially insecure life has been shown to increase the likelihood of drug abuse and participation in crime. Additionally, financial illiteracy is one of the greatest factors that keep people in the cycle of poverty.
The problem wasn’t hard to understand as I grew up in a lower-middle-class home and noticed cultural differences between my home and school experiences. I attended school in an affluent community where most students were raised in environments where financial intelligence and retirement planning were ingrained early on. I saw how setting the precedence of financial literacy allowed for better futures. Thus, I created the TeachMyMoney, a community-based organization that teaches students investing and personal finance skills. TeachMyMoney uses critical financial literacy lessons, guest speakers, and paper-trading competitions to educate students. Today, TeachMyMoney boasts over 1150 members at five Tennessee libraries.
Through my work with TeachMyMoney, I've discovered how teaching even small groups of individuals can help transform entire communities. Helping change the status quo of the current youth mindset will foster a mentality of financial preparedness and stop cyclical poverty in its tracks. ","Do you ever have any moments when you think you’re a genius? I don’t have many of those, but one time I did! Flashback to my first week at Emory, I was moving all of my clothes into the dresser when I noticed one important thing missing: a belt! It’s not like Emory’s a hop skip and jump from home, so I began to get worried. Then, in a moment when all the pieces came together, I used the shoelace of an old shoe as a belt. Boom! At that moment I was on top of the world.  ","I started refereeing soccer games at age thirteen to earn money. I quickly immersed myself into my role as a soccer referee and embraced the culture with open arms. The soccer community encouraged collaboration through diverse perspectives and individual contributions. Every halftime, the three referees, formed a circle to review the significant happenings and present them from our own perspectives and past implementations of rules. We'd discuss fouls and penalties, sanctions, and assess risk factors with each of us sharing our perspectives of the interpretation of the rule. Despite the usual challenges—unruly parents and spectators, demanding coaches, and safety concerns— we always relied on diverse experiences and perspectives to keep the game going. 
Like a community of soccer referees, brought together by cooperation, teamwork, and diversity, I endeavor to contribute EIIG by continuing to use communication and a variety of perspectives to make sound judgments and collaborate to obtain solutions to perplexing problems.

In high school, I opened two pop-up restaurants, and those experiences not only taught me valuable business lessons, but also shaped part of my worldview. 12-15 hours per day were spent on my feet, prepping, cooking, cleaning, and frankly, I was exhausted after a week. Small business owners do this for years, and I have the utmost respect for them, and would cherish an opportunity to support these to achieve their business goals. It is especially the personal connection to that draws me to EIIG, because the loans and subsequent consulting will have a tangible and significant effect on the business. This will make it so rewarding to work on projects and see the growth and success that my clients achieve. 
EIIG is also Emory’s only impact investing group. Only here can I learn how to assess the risks of loaning to businesses, how to analyze business models, and get an unparalleled and unique look into the most important stage of business—the initial funding and growth. I would love to work in private equity, so EIIG would be the perfect place to understand how the field works and gain experience that I will carry with me for the rest of my career. Who knows, at EIIG I might work on the next Coca-Cola!","Waxing lyrical about some impersonal impact is good and all, but I feel that making a tangible impact on people that I personally care about is far more important.
In high school, I was the elected chairman of the Senior Student Committee. Besides other, more official (and less fun) duties, we would plan and host every big event: Graduation Ball, Winter Ball, Spring Prom. These events are the highlights of the junior and senior years, where you and all your friends would be celebrating accomplishments or just letting off some steam (plus, a great place to take a date). Thus, we knew we had to run these flawlessly, choosing the right location, right prices, etc. Our most successful event was the Winter Ball.
My impact in the organization efforts was to act as a mediator and overseer. As a committee, we would discuss every aspect of the Ball, from the theme, to where we would host it, to the price, and I would make the final choice on each. In the end, we hosted a Ball at a hotel with a winter wonderland theme. 
Seeing everyone dressed up to the nines was a fantastic sight, and my classmates put on great shows. I was surrounded by laughing faces, friends going to other tables and toasting them, everyone enjoying the food, entertainment, and atmosphere. People that I cared about were enjoying this because of me! I helped my friends create happy and meaningful memories about high school! For this, I am happy and grateful.","I love cooking. As a not traditionally creative person (no singing, dancing, or painting for me), I have found cooking to be my creative outlet. I am a wizard: bloody meat, raw onions, water, stock, fry, stir, simmer—delicious stew. How? Magic. Regardless, I am now the chef during Chinese New Year celebrations, in charge of making the family meal on the big night. 
This meal is important. Mise en place begins, and I realize there are no ingredients for a dish, and that there are a lot of leftover ingredients. To kill two birds with one stone, I fry the random mishmash of leftover ingredients with an egregious amount of garlic, shallots, and lard, which turns out delicious. 
I patted myself on the back. Creatively, I made sure there were 8 dishes (a lucky amount) and simultaneously reduced waste.","Middle school was not the best experience for me, and I’m sure many people share the same sentiment. I was that kid that hid in his room while other people did activities, or I’d be sulking in the corner. My high school’s year long boarding program, called Hangzhou, changed me into who I am today. 
I came into Hangzhou bitter, angry, and scared—but determined to be better. My first success came during the annual dragon boat race that Hangzhou holds. I was in the boat, giving half-assed strokes and slowing the entire boat down. In a moment of clarity, I saw that in front of me, my friend was giving his all; behind me, another friend was yelling a chant, pushing us all. I was thrust out of my own head by the energy of the community around me and realized how embarrassing I was. Despite not winning the race, I still felt ecstatic, of being part of a bigger thing—and that mentality of participating and trying still resides within me.  
The Hangzhou community brought out the best in me. Events like the dragon boat race were common, and I grew immensely from those. My personality became far more open, optimistic, and outgoing. I not only became better at socializing, but also became more caring, considerate, and helpful. Through great conversations with fellow Hangzhou members, I have not only developed lifelong friendships but also changed the values I hold dear. Without Hangzhou’s community, I would not be who I am today. ",,2.833333333333333,0.351,-0.558,

As I got older, downtown became ""trendier"", causing rental prices to rise and thus pushing out small businesses. My neighborhood became more and more foreign to me and I started losing the ties which held my community together. At EIIG, I hope to use my professional passions to help finance and support small business entrepreneurs in Atlanta. While I can't go back and help my old neighborhood in New York, I'm motivated to support local businesses in Atlanta because I know just how valuable they are.
Investment and business have long been interests of mine and I feel that EIIG is the perfect environment for me to both gain real-life experience and expand my reach in Atlanta. Having attended a completely French school K-12th grade, my personal values have many ties to French culture. In France, over 99% of businesses are defined as small, which is why many large, American corporations have trouble succeeding there. By keeping producers small, they greatly improve the quality of their goods and produce. I feel that another central issue in the reduction in small businesses is that we lose the craftsmanship and effort put into the creation of our goods, resulting in everything becoming ""standardized"". I want to fight for Atlanta's entrepreneurs, for its community, and for singularity.
","When our world was abruptly overtaken by a pandemic in the middle of my sophomore year, I observed the reactions of frontline workers, politicians, my school, and my family. Emerging months later from quarantine’s enforced solitude and introspection, I had an interesting clarity about my role in the world and what kind of impact I wanted to have on those around me. That summer, I connected with two like-minded peers to found the Financial Literacy Club (FLC). Leveraging knowledge from a marketing course taken during lockdown, I marketed a website for rolling articles. To appeal to younger audiences, I launched social media pages and wrote, designed, and posted creative infographics. We built up team of students interested in finance from the New York area and gave them regular lessons on important financial topics. With this information, they were able to make their own contributions by writing articles for our weekly newsletter. As our membership and impact grew, we decided to incorporate FLC and achieved 501(c)(3) status in 2022. We then added additional platforms for audience interaction by hosting Zoom panels with speakers like Jared Dillian, creating podcasts, managing a stock simulator competition, and raising a scholarship fund. Through my passion for finance and investing, I was able to create a successful nonprofit with my peers and educate others while learning new things myself.
","In the fall of 2021, I signed up for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society's year-long fundraising program called Students of the Year. While fundraising is usually done through live events, my group and I soon realized that COVID posed a great challenge. I had the privilege of attending a private school and noticed that many parents and students wore expensive clothes or bags. I decided that a luxury goods drive would be the perfect opportunity to raise money without breaking COVID distancing guidelines. Over the next few months, I spent my free time sending out emails promoting my drive to students and parents and then coordinating with The RealReal, a luxury consignment store, to sell their donated goods on the site. My efforts were a great success and I managed to raise over $5,000, helping my group secure the number 1 spot as New York's Students of the Year.
","Although I was born and raised in New York city, I attended a French school my entire life. Classes were always taught in French, my closest friends were from France, and rather than prepping us for the SATs, my school readied us for the French baccalaureate. The French schooling system is different from the American system in that it’s much more grounded in the liberal arts, which meant taking classes in every subject up until senior year. I feel that this community has shaped my outlook on education and allowed me to find an interest in nearly every academic subject. It has also given me an international perspective on life, which translates through my personal values and interactions with others.

While doing so, they face a lot of obstacles, but don’t have the right financial resources to solve them. Furthermore, in school, I have actively worked to help small businesses by organising many fundraisers in different capacities. EIIG just does that by providing microloans to local entrepreneurs who don’t have immediate access to capital. This service would enable the small businesses to flourish without worrying about the present resources. Along with this, EIIG’s long term mission to close the micro- business gap excites me as that’s what I have been working on. Additionally, providing investing to small Atlanta owned businesses excites the philanthropic side of me. Getting to work with and give back to small businesses in form of early- stage financing would enable me to be in the process of cultivation of a small business from the very start. EIIG would also enable me to broaden my horizon and learn about different industries and products along the way. Being in EIIG would also act as a learning curve for me as with every investment, I’ll tend to learn more and more.

Needless to say, the decision to register didn’t warrant much deliberation. The final pitch of my business idea, KnowledgeX, secured my team with the highly coveted Runners Up title. The venture, a platform to exchange pre-owned books, was highly appreciated by the panel of renowned venture capitalists.

The path to the culmination of this journey included acquainting myself with research methodologies, comprehending market sizing, and deciphering competitor analysis. This facilitated the entrepreneurial mindset I had believed to have covertly hidden. My exceptional performance in the cohort ( top 5%), and being selected as a teacher assistant to Sarah Beston, a professor at Columbia Business School, was exhilarating. 

In the process of providing guidance and assistance to Middle East students on the fundamentals of business planning, I also developed indispensable skills that added finesse to my interpersonal and communication skills. Benefiting in inexplicable ways, this proved to be a symbiotic relationship. Eventually, this experience concluded with the students developing a business model that won them the best branding award. I was nominated as the brand ambassador for the Program where I contributed to outreach activities including hosting an interactive entrepreneurship session in my school. 

The experience opened new doors for me, including my social venture, “TalentEx”, a platform for skills development of underprivileged kids.

In my school’s student council, I played a pivotal role in launching an initiative tailored to address children’s mental health issues. A common sentiment around the school campus was that students were facing a lot of anxiety due to large amounts of academic pressure. This led us as the student council to come up with a creative solution to address the issue. I suggested that we should come up with an idea which ensures anonymity while giving students a community to share their mental health issues with others. The implementation of this plan took a long time, but it finally seemed to have worked out when we launched our first care circle module in school. The students were very receptive of the Care Circle and emailed positive feedback about the initiative. Hence, this has to be an instance where I expressed myself creatively.
","Born in the Jain religion, I was ‘supposed’ to attend the weekend ‘pathshala’ (value education school) to learn about the vices of anger, greed, ego and practice truth and non-violence. I always objected to do so. However, now I feel that growing up in such an environment greatly influenced my understanding and outlook towards life.

It became the strong foundation that immensely helped me overcome instances of when I was bullied or when my peers indulged in escapades that didn’t facilitate their growth while I refrained. Highly influenced by my father, I also attended a 2.5-day meditation retreat. I participated in and moderated webinars where the youth deliberated on peer pressure and practical issues.

I believe being a part of the Emory Impact Investing Group is the perfect opportunity to do so. In my first semester, I chose to take the upper-level, most challenging Economics classes offered while overloading another Goizueta business class. Working on applied finance in a laboratory setting with group members at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in high school made me long for more exposure to explore finance in the real world setting. I have also participated in Wharton Global High School Investment Competition, and I was placed top 10 out of 1155 students in the Wharton Summer Badgr Competition.

Some other related courses I took or am currently taking include Accounting, Communications in the Digital Age, Business Data and Decision Analytics, etc.
Aside from challenging myself in terms of coursework to enhance my business and analytical skills, I have always enjoyed communicating with clients, especially when they are around the globe. I started and am currently running(for five years now) an international reselling business under Alibaba. With experience in organizing orders, documenting financial information, and managing post-sale assessments and all professional communications, I genuinely wish to contribute what I have to a greater community that is EIIG. ","Across six time zones and ten countries, a tribe of hyper-focused Potterheads opened their Xianyu apps, ready to snatch an album at any second. All the bidders need to do is call out “pai” (like dibs), and they might win a diamond for their precious collection. Xianyu of Alibaba is a platform for second-hand trading. Used-product markets—like garage sales or thrift stores—are rare in China, where people prefer new items for top dollar, so Xianyu is a special harbor amidst this thunderstorm of consumerism.
More recently, however, new users poured into Xianyu to sell brand-new products, effectively ruining its eco and price-friendly image. Frustrated by this shift towards ecommerce extravagance, I collaborated with other passionate auctioneers and wrote to Xianyu management urging them to restrict the platform to preowned objects. Selling an unwanted item to someone who’ll love and cherish it is a superb feeling, and even as middlemen, we feel like we’ve accomplished something powerful whenever we connect a giver with a hoper. I’ll continue fighting to keep Xianyu as a refuge for second-hand goods, waste-reduction, and the people whose values are about more than money.","In high school, when I began teaching elementary students the basics of economics, I encountered single-minded money worship, a mindset that many young students inherit from their parents. I took it upon myself to present econ as more humanistic and community-oriented, seeking inspiration from countless subjects. 
I sought outside sources, creating bizarre yet fascinating connections between economic theories and movies. In Zootopia, when one banker lemming turned to buy a Nick’s Pawpsicle, the rest immediately followed suit, and I was given the opportunity to teach about crowd effect as giggles filled the chatroom. From examining Nick’s entrepreneur skills selling Pawpsicles to discussing the production possibilities curve of scream energy and sushi in Monsters University, the class learned about economics without relying on the shallow zeal for money and personal advancement.
The students left the course with memories of Disney characters making allocative decisions and the earthly side of economics; this was exactly what I wanted to achieve—a new view of economics, one driven by fun and community, while drawing exciting connections between disciplines.","I’m a treasure hunter, and Xianyu of Alibaba was where I found my ""gold"".
That day, we were auctioning an album of Ron Weasley trading cards from a Potterhead friend of mine. She was moving homes and simply couldn’t take her collection along, so I convinced her to list the album. I knew someone out there would treasure it. I took advantage of my previous hands-on selling experience and marketing skills I learned from eBay vendors, taking particular care with the camera work. The video needed to be eye-catching, so I picked a brick-wall background that imitated Diagon Alley and took pictures under soft light. Because the Xianyu logarithm favors items that are clearly categorized, I crafted a concise description using the most commonly-used keywords in the collectors community. Though it was on the brink of being discarded, the Weasley album received overwhelming love, bids flooded in, and the “half sell, half donate” auction turned out to be a huge win-win.
I’m proud to be a part of the Xianyu of Alibaba community where I get to turn one person’s “trash” into another’s treasure.",,2.75,0.339,-0.559,

After studying AP economics, I can´t stop relating real-life business cases with economics. I found that business cases follow certain economic principles; However, there are also differences between all the cases. Some of them are more profitable than the others. An important factor that cause this difference is us-- business people. I love to be that businesswoman to help the clients maximize their benefit and achieve their financial goals. I want learn from the knowledgeable businesspeople in EIIG and share though with elite peers here. 

Beside the support of businesspeople, capital is also important in achieving success. A lots of small business with promising future profit failed at the first step. Some of them lack fund to produce their first batch of products, some cannot afford R&D after several months and were forced to give-up halfway. I feel that these small business are so underrated and my heart hurt a lot knowing of the truth that people with limited resources have difficulties in become wealthy, which lead to increasing wealth gaps in the society. 

EIIG gives Emory students an opportunity to help those underestimated local entrepreneurs achieve their goals by providing microloans to them and I love to see them gaining more opportunities with our investments. ","I am always passionate about healthcare. Good medical products cures people and free people from pain. 

Thus, I cooperated with my friend to design a software that can analyze the electrocardiogram of patients. In rural areas with limited healthcare resources and professional doctors, it is very useful because it’s accuracy of above 96.8%.  

In order to promote that product, I performed market analysis, and reached out to clinics in rural areas started a 3-month trial. I also distributed questionnaires to calculate our market in individual users. 

After getting a positive feedback, I raised fund of $2874 through charity sale and the fund goes to purchase of cloud service and marketing. Eventually, we have monthly user of about 300 individuals and 20 clinics, helping more than 1000 patients monthly, and started to generate profit to sustain our business operations and further R&D. 

It is important for me because it is beneficial for the society and is also generating profit. ","When I was competing in Yale MUN, I work under the leadership of a bloc leader. The cooperation was good until we have disputes on the statements in the working paper.A lot of bloc member agree that  one of his statement is too autocratic and will not win support. However, he refused to delete that. 

To protect our stance and discourse power, I created a new bloc with more comprehensive statements of policies so that more countries can benefit. With limited time, I recruited block members and wrote a new working paper. 

During voting procedure, the working paper of my new block was passed by majority of delegates. 

I let this bad cooperation experience happen because I know as delegate of a country, the country stance and the issuance of beneficial policies is of more importance. ","I have been playing in volleyball team for 5 years and it has already be a part of me.

Specifically, the process that EIIG takes each entrepreneur through is what piqued my interested. In the initial stages of EIIG’s development process, entrepreneurs are taken through an in-depth due diligence process and the analysis that comes with it is something I've always wanted to learn more about. Everything from credit analysis to risk assessment are skills I would be able to gain a greater grasp of as part of the analyst side. Alongside the due-diligence process, EIIG also helps entrepreneurs through every step, including repayment. While entrepreneurs are repaying their loans, EIIG offers useful consulting services which is something I’ve always wanted to learn more about. Apart from just who to invest in and why, I’m interested to see how small businesses grow and what strategies work when navigating a new business. Alongside the process itself, I’m also interested in the reach EIIG has across the small business hub that is the Atlanta area, as small business creation is essential to creating a foundation for communities that need growth. Being able to nurture the growth of such critical new businesses combined with the fact that there are so many different types of businesses in the area would provide an amazing opportunity to get exposure into such an impactful area of investing.","While completing my junior year of high school, a friend approached me with an idea to start a microfinance club at our high school. Witnessing other schools successfully establish similar clubs, we were eager to start our own version, and quickly delved into developing a framework. Over the next few months, we created guidelines and plans for fundraising money to invest in entrepreneurs all over the world, through the online platform Kiva. At the beginning of our senior year, we advertised to the student body and quickly gained a large membership, and continued to organize fundraising events and meetings to effectively utilize our money. While the first few months were spent learning about the process, we gained a lot of knowledge about how to conduct a thorough analysis of entrepreneurs, and what to look for when choosing where to put our money. In December of 2021 we were able to make our first investment into an entrepreneur in Kenya, which led to more investments in the coming months. While seeing the impact our investments had on people all over the world was something I'm proud of, it was also extremely fulfilling to witness the culture we had created around microfinance. Every single person who showed up to club meetings and fundraising events was genuinely interested in our initiative, and being able to foster that passion is something I would never forget.
","While most of my work as a freelance graphic designer has been mostly mundane, small tasks that don’t require a lot of creative thinking. There are a few projects where I've been able to truly express my personality in my work, while also following guidelines. More times than I can count I was given very vague instructions, with a fast-approaching deadline, and not much to work with. It’s times like these that I've been able to truly express myself creatively, as I often am confined by guidelines and wants from a client. ","Growing up the child of an immigrant, I never felt as connected to my culture as my cousins back home. They’d grown up the same way my parents did: surrounded by family and in our small coastal city in south India. I, on other hand, only got to experience where I came from during our occasional vacations to India. Thankfully, my parents made sure to involve me in KANE (Kerala Association of New England), and while I resisted at first being an arrogant child, I’m thankful now for the opportunities it’s given me. Being surrounded by families who were also experiencing the same cultural disconnect allowed me to understand and cope with the feeling of missing out I had experienced. Whether it was setting up for charity events, or the monthly get-together we had, I was able to be apart of an organization that felt more like a family.",,2.708333333333333,0.33,-0.607,

As a student who is both passionate about learning about businesses and helping others, this club combines both of my interests. I have always had an interest in math and financial concepts leading me to pursue a career in finance. 

The ability to work directly with these business owners strikes me as a truly unique opportunity to gain real world, hands-on experience. Through my summer internships at OpenCity, summer job at Camp Playland, and leadership roles through Girls Who Code and Kool 2 Be Kind, I believe I have built some of the necessary skills to contribute to EIIG and the local entrepreneurs. However, the additional skills that I can build from this experience: evaluating businesses, learning the bank lending process, and working with a team of like minded students is something I’m really excited about and view as an integral part of my development at Goizueta. ","A problem that is prevalent in the world today is that litter continues to clog our oceans, rivers, streams, and fields. While I walked the streets of my hometown there would always be empty bottles, napkins, cups, and other trash items lying on the side of the street. Many people would drive by or walk past and ignore the trash. After seeing what my town looked like, I began to participate in many cleanups to help my community. During these clean-ups, I would use the Literati app which allowed me to take pictures of the trash and submit it for other users to see what was being picked up. This app has motivated me to continue to pick up trash regardless of where I am. I am very passionate about making sure the community is clean because trash is impacting more than just the looks of the town, it is impacting the Earth as a whole. 
	
After spending a lot of time cleaning up trash, I have become more aware of the new technology businesses have created in order to efficiently pick up trash around the world. This passion of mine has led me to do research and keep myself up to date on new inventions that will benefit the environment.","While interning for OpenCity, an artificial intelligence (AI) restaurant drive-thru technology company, I was able to express myself creatively to build brand awareness. I worked with a team to develop TikTok videos to showcase their new technology, Tori the pleasant, easy to hear, and loyal AI drive-thru assistant. To appeal to the consumers of the product, I used empathy and put myself in the position of a customer to test out the possible frustrations they often experience while going through a drive-thru. In all parts of my life from school to friends, jobs, or internships, when approaching a problem I tend to use empathy to understand the needs and wants of the other people involved to strengthen my solutions.","I joined the organization Kool 2 Be Kind in the beginning of high school, influenced by the memory of high school students teaching me about empathy during my elementary school years. When older students came into the classroom, it was clear they valued being kind. The lessons I learned as a child stuck, and the roles were reversed as I then taught younger elementary students about kindness. I was proud to be an active member of the club and serve on the Executive Board. It was clear that the lesson plans influenced others and acts of kindness spread throughout the community. Growing up around people who have been kind and understanding has shaped me to be the confident, hardworking, and passionate person I am today.

Being part of EIIG will allow me to truly make a difference in the communities surrounding me. 

My passion for supporting local businesses and entrepreneurship can be seen from my past experiences. I was the cohost of the Aspiring Entrepreneurs Forum at Emory University. During this event, we invited entrepreneurs from startups located across the Atlanta Tech village. Throughout this event, I also networked with Shot Makers League, which is a fantasy basketball startup I currently intern for. 
During this event, a major of my role involved researching the startups in which I assessed their financial situations, their business models, and conducted market research. I believe these skills align with the Research members' role of conducting background checks on businesses and determining whether businesses are eligible for our loans and funds. Additionally, as a BBA student pursuing in OAM, my background in consulting will prepare me well as an analyst. 

Lastly, I can't wait to be part of EIIG, and contribute my part to truly make a difference in my communities!


","Everyone I know has all told me something like this, “David, you are like a giant energy ball, and you always infect everyone with your unique, bubbly energy. During college, I allowed my personality to thrive, and I became an orientation leader.

When I became an OL, I decided that no matter what, I want to make my first years feel like they are at home  — as their trusted friend before I am their leader. I would always greet my first years with the biggest smile, not because it was part of my job, but because I am genuinely happy to see them. As group 25, we developed our own unique chant as a way to unify our group, we created our own unique bonding activities, and we formed our little family. Whether it is the photo challenge or the small group meetings, my group always has the loudest chant, the most joyous laughter, and the most amount of fun. 

I have always believed that in order to be a good leader, your group has to genuinely respect, trust, and love you. Being an OL was so unique to me as it not only taught me how to be a leader, but it also gifted me a new family through the process. This is also something I hope to gain from EIIG: gaining professional development, but also most importantly, developing a new family made up of my peers whom I can trust throughout my career.

","During the past summer, I worked as a tennis professional where I lead high school counselors and directed the tennis programs at a Hospitality company called The Bay Club. During the first day of camp, many of the children who signed up showed up without a tennis raquets. That presented many problems as we could not proceed with any of the pre planned tennis programs when the children did not have a raquet. Thinking on my feet, I splitted up the children into different groups, and created a game that mimicked the game of ""Hand tennis"" where children would have to toss the ball back and forth to each other while performing the motion of a raquet swing with their arm. This way, even without the raquets, the children still get to practice their ball coordination with each other, getting a sense of the sport, while still having fun during the process. The game that I came up with was so successful that the director of tennis permanently incorporated that game into the tennis program aftewards. ","I didn't discover the art of dance until quarantine happened. From learning a basic arm wave to qualifying for dance battles, and now to co-planning a Hip Hop Festival at Emory with my dance professor, Dance has evolved from a hobby to an unremovable part of my lifestyle, and a large part of that is due to the amazing dance community surrounding me. When I first started dancing, I seeked help from other dancers around the world for tips on my movements, and unanimously, every single dancer encouraged me to explore the creativity side of dance, saying that the beauty of dance lies in the unknown. As time went on, my understanding on this phrase deepened, as I became more open minded, more in tune of my mind and body connection, and just fell in love with the freestyle part of dance. 

With the help of the dance community,  I can truly express myself with absolute creative freedom without the fear of judgment, and I start to see the many different sides of beauty in life. ",,2.6875,0.327,-0.613,

Because I have lived in Atlanta for my entire life, I feel a meaningful connection to the city and I want to see its residents flourish. I went to a high school where there was an obvious disparity between the opportunities that were provided to white students and students of color. When I see the work that EIIG is doing to tackle these disparities and aid small business owners, especially those of color, I feel that the club is making a real impact in a community that is important to me. I want to join EIIG because I want to give back to the people that make this city a thriving, diverse place to live. I hope to gain valuable experience in working with real entrepreneurs, providing consulting services, and learning how to solve problems to optimize business operations. EIIG stands out from other clubs because it feels like the members have more personal connections to the business they serve. I especially like the fact that the club continues relations with its clients throughout the duration of the loan and even afterward. I want to be a part of a club that makes a real difference, in addition to providing members with experience and training, and I can tell that EIIG cares about doing that.","I apologize, unfortunately I ran out of time for this question. I genuinely want to join this club.","In 2020, my mom’s boyfriend moved in with us. I was happy for my mom to be able to have someone with whom she could share the burden of running a household. However, it soon became clear that his arrival exacerbated the relationship problems that existed before he moved in. My mom had to divide her energy between work, her children, and ensuring her partner felt at home. Because of this, I lost touch with my mom. She loves playing the guitar, so my pandemic project was learning the guitar as a means of reconnecting with her. I found that the guitar helped me channel my emotions about the situation into a positive outlet. When we played together, it was like the stress from other aspects of life took a backseat and we were able to regain that bond that we had always shared. ","My mother began taking my sister and I to a Quaker church when I was five. Initially, I was opposed to the idea because religion had never really been part of our family life. My mother’s parents were Presbyterian and so I had been exposed to “traditional” Christian services, but Quaker services were nothing like I had experienced. Quaker worship consists entirely of silent prayer, where the congregation gathers in a room together with no pastor, no bibles, and no music, and each person uses the time to pray individually. As a kid, I disliked the services. It was impossible to sit still or keep my mind from wandering. We kept attending through high school and over time, I grew to appreciate these periods of silent internal reflection.

The environment at EIIG embodies my enthusiasm and enables me to forge enduring connections. Every position I've held has had one thing in common: the individuals I met and the lessons I learned from working with or for them.
In the short time I spent talking with Eden and Rishav, I learned how EIIG made a real difference by sharing their views. EIIG is a community working together to achieve a common objective in enhancing Emory's impact in ethical business. During my time as a board member at scholars of finance, I have been introduced to the ethics associated with the financial field. EIIG represents ""business for social good"" and represents a group I want to be part of and develop within.","As a research member of EIIG, I was tasked with answering the research question, “How has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted the digitization of small businesses, and how did the digitization of small businesses impact their own productivity?” Understanding the perspectives of companies such as restaurants that were forced to shut down from COVID-19 through further research sparked a passion of mine for preventing these stores from continuing to struggle. Our team addressed the practices and strategies necessary to maximize businesses' productivity through digitization. Through the advances in areas of the creation, transformation, storage, and analysis aspects of digital data, businesses will be able to expand past their potential. Through our extensive research, we provide answers to these types of questions with ideas based on the strengths and limitations of how easily and effectively companies can digitize while simultaneously playing on the strengths and limitations of small businesses. I eventually came to the conclusion that the impact of COVID-19 has harmed the progression of countless companies. However, COVID-19 has introduced an increasing industry in the E-commerce field. The introduction of Digitization opens doors to countless opportunities as companies such as Amazon and Walmart have flourished in taking full advantage of the COVID Mandates. We eventually presented this research to the Analysts at the research symposium, who considered our research in future investments within the club, which highly resonated with my values of improving the lives of struggling companies. ","Being a part of the Varsity High school men's tennis team at Northview my Freshman year introduced me to a toxic nature within players of the team. Having been a part of the team for three years, I was placed in a captain position during my senior year. I administered open practices and incorporated a challenge ladder system, which allowed players to challenge each other in matches to take a particular position in which they played. We frequently would also have dinners outside of tennis practices to spend quality time with each other and build genuine friendships. I felt that making every player feel vital and included within the team was of the utmost importance to me, and I made sure to pursue that important as we won the state championship in my final year at Northview high school.

This led me to take up various activities in my high school career such as participating in the Wharton Global Invest Competition, FinWiz, SupportSmall, and writing a comprehensive research paper on the GameStop crisis with MIT professor- Dr. Nagisa Tadjfar and interning at SREI Infrastructure- one of the biggest NBFCs in India.

Having a strong background in investments, through the Emory Impact Investing Group I aspire to widen this existing background and learn by deep diving into Impact Investing. The idea of allocating funds to companies to seek a social impact while simultaneously getting financial returns really interests me. Through the EIIG I will get the opportunity to work with like minded peers who are deeply interested in the fields of investing and finance, while also being able to connect with professionals and alumni in the field of investing.

Being a part of the EIIG will give the opportunity to gain practical knowledge about the market and will provide me with hands-on work experience. Research Opportunities about potential investments and portfolio management will be an enriching experience for me. Being a part of the EIIG will give me the opportunity to make a positive impact in the community of Atlanta. 

Through EIIG i aspire to gain experience that can also be implemented in one of my existing initiatives- ‘SupportSmall’. This was an initiative of mine which aimed to help distressed local business that were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by registering them on online platforms and e-markets.
","Realizing that my peers lacked basic financial awareness on saving and investing, I co-founded a student-led organization, FinWiz which aims to spread financial literacy amongst teens. By writing blogs on relevant topics, we hope to educate our peers in a manner that is relatable to them. After being a member of FinWiz for 2 years, I took over as President for the following 2 years. 
During my tenure as President, I hoped to expand the reach of FinWiz and tried to do so by implementing an annual paper trading competition - the Young Investors Challenge (YIC). 
The first YIC was held on American markets, but due to difference in time zones and understandably a lack of knowledge about the American indexes many students who had initially shown interest eventually pulled out. The lack of participation in the first edition made it very clear to me that we needed to conduct future editions on the Indian markets to generate a greater response. 
To ensure a resounding success the next time, I searched the internet for virtual trading platforms on the Indian stock market. Unable to find a suitable option, we created our very own platform! Making our own platform was no easy feat and the biggest hurdle I faced was convincing my team members that the effort would be worthwhile. With the change in format we were able to increase participation by about 70 percent and integrate a resources tool into the platform making it an educational resource as well. 
My stint as president of FinWiz taught me how innovative thinking, collective efforts and a never-give-up attitude are the key ingredients for a successful stint as a leader.
","Last year with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the whole world went into lockdown, causing the global economy to come to an unprecedented halt. Apart from the impact on public health, local and small businesses were severely hit. Big players in the industry used this time to capitalize on the reliance of consumers on e-commerce platforms, while those who could not operate virtually lost out on most of their demand and customers. 
In my locality I often heard the owners of corner shops and kirana stores complain that the pandemic had taken away their means of livelihood and had destroyed their business. Through ‘Support Small’ I aimed to help local businesses that are adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic by registering them on e-markets such as Amazon and Flipkart. Through ‘Support Small’ I helped multiple business owners not only regain their means of livelihood but also expand their business in a way that was not expected by them.","Having grown up amidst a community of entrepreneurs, I observed that casual dinner party conversations often revolved around the Indian stock market. Deeply enamored with the world of finance, I began learning about stocks, bonds, investments, etc. This predicament led me to find like-minded peers who had an interest in investing but no avenue to learn and grow. 
As most members of our community are minors, we cannot open our own investing account resulting in investing in virtual paper trading competitions or routing investments through our parents. We spend anywhere between a few minutes to a few hours every day discussing daily stock prices, having heated debates on which position to hold, and analyzing different trends. 
Realizing that the youth lack financial awareness on saving and investing, a few senior members of our community founded FinWiz, an initiative to provide financial literacy to teens. After being a member of FinWiz for 3 years, I have taken over as President.

I believe my work in economic policy research and experience learning from female entrepreneurs provide a strong foundation to be a productive member of EIIG.
 
While in high school, I published economic policy research for the Institute for Youth in Policy (YIP), a youth-lead non-partisan think tank, where I wrote articles on a wide variety of economic policy topics. I feel as though the areas of economics I’ve researched are relevant to EIIG’s mission as they introduced me to a range of financial concepts, as well as the importance and volatility of small business, particularly during the Covid-era. One of the most rewarding parts of my experience at YIP was working with teams of people from across the country with diverse backgrounds. I enjoyed the collaborative process of developing a thesis and pressure testing it with alternative points of view.
 
I also value my experience as an active member of the Emory Women in Business (WIB) club, where I serve as the Freshman Representative for Finance and Marketing. I find importance in increasing the number of women in the male-saturated field of business and recognize the value in making the Atlanta business market more equitable. ","My favorite course last semester was MATH 111. I excelled in the class and truly enjoyed the material. As a result of my performance, my professor suggested I apply to be a Learning Assistant (LA) for the course this semester. I eagerly applied to the program and earned the position. 
 
Though unsure of what to expect, I approached the first session with excitement; I felt ready to demonstrate my understanding of math concepts, hoping to help ease the difficulty of Calculus 1 for MATH 111 students. 
 
Four calculus students arrived at the first meeting, which was more than expected as the semester had just begun. I felt intimidated by the four senior students sitting before me, eager to better comprehend their class material. I spent my four years in high school tutoring middle school students, most often in math, so using a tone and approach suitable for college seniors posed a challenge. I had to balance explaining and solving problems from a worksheet, answering questions thoroughly, and respecting the notable age difference. I was flattered by their shock after learning I was a freshman. At the same time, I felt a justification for my math skills and love of the subject was necessary to legitimize my role. 
 
Despite a few moments of slight awkwardness after disclosing my age, the students refocused on the material and continued asking clarifying questions and working through difficult problems. Ultimately, I felt respected as a freshman LA, and felt proud of my teaching skills, ability to adapt, and my understanding of calculus. "," 
While attending a zoom conference three summers ago, I heard from a nine-year-old boy who continued playing baseball, his favorite sport, despite suddenly losing his arm in an accident. 
 
Shortly after the zoom, I began my involvement with the Challenged Athletes Foundation (CAF), stepping out of my comfort zone to become a part of a unique, tight knit community of people committed to helping physically limited athletes. In June 2020, with the help of CAF, I met an eighteen-year-old top ranked tennis player who is wheelchair-bound. She shared her struggles of not only playing tennis while in a wheelchair, but also finding accessible tennis courts to play on.
 
Feeling compelled to share Joanna’s story, I helped organize a CAF event for tennis players with physical disabilities and introduced my tennis teammates to the organization. Though the problem that disabled athletes face is not solved, I strived to help create an inclusive, active environment for CAF athletes so they can continue doing what they love. ","In January 2021, during the Washington D.C. Capital Riots, several rioters wore shirts that read “6MWE” (6 Million Wasn’t Enough), referencing the Holocaust where 6 million Jewish people were killed. In May, because of battles in the Gaza Strip, an outburst of anti-Semitic acts erupted throughout the United States. These two instances of antagonism stood out to me among other instances of Jew-hatred.
 
The sharp rise in antisemitism led me to learn more about my heritage and engage more deeply with my Jewish community as I leaned on fellow Jews for support during such a troubling time. I facilitated discussions at my school’s Jewish Culture Club regarding the rise in antisemitism and led a Q&A with a Holocaust survivor. This semester I enrolled in a Jewish studies course where I am not only learning about the diversity and history of Jewish beliefs and practices in the United States, but also meeting an engaged group of Jewish students.

The recruiter was knowledgeable about the true meaning of the club and explained in detail the mission and dealings he has with while working with EIIG. As someone who has worked for a small business in Brooklyn, New York, I understand the importance of these storefronts. As the oven man in a wonderful pizza shop, I witnessed the impact on the community, giving out slices to kids walking home from school, or firemen on break during their shifts. They have a way of bringing together a community in fantastic ways, but often times these businesses struggle. Over the past few years, the pandemic has shined a light on small businesses whether it was because of a lack of customers, difficulty hiring, or issues with the city in terms of zoning and rent hikes. In the rapidly growing city of Atlanta, impoverished neighborhoods are experiencing a renaissance, new businesses are opening everywhere and the local economy is flourishing. However, as many do, assistance is needed for new small businesses especially ones in less fortunate areas. I would love to have the opportunity to work directly with these owners to figure out the best route forward for them to create a flourishing business that creates a positive impact on the community."," Playing baseball has always been a part of my life. I grew up playing travel ball and loved the game like nothing else. Moving forward, I played high-school baseball and became co-captain of the team as a junior. As a senior, I was excited for the season, but the day before our first game, the pandemic struck. The season was canceled. I ended up deciding to take a gap year. Because of this, I was not able to play baseball the whole year. Before freshman year, I prepared for fall ball at Emory, but I tore my rotator cuff. I entered physical therapy for three months and missed the 2021 fall season. In my sophomore year fall semester, I decided to walk on to the team even though I had not played competitive baseball in three years. I immediately fell back in love with the game and had a wonderful experience trying out for the team. After the first month of practice, the first fall game came around. In my first at-bat, I got a hit. It was a massive accomplishment for me. Unfortunately, the day after I was informed I did not make the team. Although this was hard to hear, I was extremely proud of myself. The impact was great I was honored to try out for a varsity college team. This segment of my life will always be important and displayed that when I put my heart and mind into something, I can accomplish my goal.","The soft serve parlor in the DCT includes cones and bowls. While the system is efficient, sometimes my schedule conflicts with eating ice cream in the DCT. When I have class, a to-go version is preferable. While the cone is the primary method, sometimes they are out of stock, leaving a pile of bowls. At first, I would have to eat there or go without ice cream because I had places to be, but soon I discovered an alternative method. A few stations over is a waffle machine and there are small plastic containers to fill up the pre-made mix. I noticed these to-go cups and thought they could be ample size for ice cream. Sure enough, they are the perfect container for ice cream. I’ve shown some friends the discovery I made and we often use this convenient method when we need to get back to our busy days. ","My mother is a Rabbi, which means I grew up going to temple multiple times a week. This undoubtedly affected my identity. I was kosher until the age of 15, a topic of frequent in my family. I identify as a jew and remain involved in the Jewish community on campus and at home. Following Judaism, I have made meaningful friendships at sleep-away camp and within the Emory community. These deep bonds will last the remainder of my life. I wear a Jewish necklace, celebrate the holidays, and participate in services. While in high school, I worked as a teacher’s assistant at my temple’s Hebrew school and gained experience working with children and adults. In the future, I plan to remain connected to the religion and raise my kids Jewish. This integral part of my life has shaped friendships, provided me with cultural values, and shaped my childhood.

In high school, I was part of the social impact investment club, where we helped small nonprofits by loaning them money with lower interest rates. I would love to continue this in college, and EIIG would be the best club for me. I am really passionate about getting hands-on experience with businesses and helping businesses thrive through investment. I am a quick learner, adapt quickly, and am dedicated when I commit to something. I hope to learn more about the business world as I am still somewhat new, and I hope that EIIG can help me advance my business experience. I also believe that EIIG allows me to engage with many aspects of business, get a full array of aspects of marketing, and finance while researching companies. As I am still undecided of which business major I want, I feel EIIG can help me explore more. ","Wrestling was a huge activity/sport that I was very invested in, in high school. At the beginning of wrestling, I treated the sport as a joke with 0 dedication and not treating practice and my peers with respect. But, soon enough, the older kids and captains of the team started to help me, train me, and make me better at the sport. Seeing how dedicated they were to the sport helped me get better and reach a new level of dedication. Soon I became the wrestling captain in my senior year, and I could do the same for the first- and second-year students looking up to me. I became a good role model as the older captains did for me. Wrestling helped me learn about dedication, loyalty, respect, and how to be part of a team and support your teammates through win or loss. I feel like I was also able to teach this as captain.","I expressed myself creatively to solve a problem in my high school investment club. One example is that we need to raise $5,000 within the school students to give to these non-profit organizations. But one year we were running low, so I decided to help with the marketing and financial part of the club. We had to brainstorm ideas, to make more money. The club in order to make money usually has bake sales for the students, however this wasn't working well enough. So it was my idea to wait for the big events such as homecoming and graduations, and other events in which the parents arrive on campus. When the parents were on campus, we gave out merchandise for the club and bake sales. With the extra money coming from the parents we were able to meet our quota.","Not to be repetitive, but I feel like the wrestling and soccer community I was a part of in high school shaped my identity. I feel like being part of a team greatly helped me shape my identity because you learn to respect, support, and gain an appreciation for your teammates. I feel like I learned so many valuable lessons in soccer, where I depend on my team for support in the match and outside, and wrestling, which is a very physically intensive sport. You need your teammates to help and support you emotionally through all your struggles. I learned to be part of a team and to support those around you, because you may need support from them as well.",,2.5625,0.299,-0.749,

As a finance student, I have had an insight into the impact of investments and influxes of capital on large corporations and investors alike. In partaking in the Emory Impact Investments Group's (EIIG) mission, I will be able to not only exercise my understanding of finance but do so in a way that has a meaningful and lasting impact on my immediate community. Additionally, as the son of a small business owner in the Dallas area, I know firsthand the opportunities associated with access to capital. During the initial years of operations, lack of capital prevented expansion and significantly limited the impact of our organization. It is my desire to bridge my experiences in a manner that enables positive social change and personal growth. I believe that EIIG is the perfect platform to pursue ambitious goals and gain essential experience applicable to academia, career, and most importantly, community. ","Composed mainly of low-income LatinX and African American first-generation students, my high school wasn’t your typical pipeline to college. During my penultimate year of high school a cohort of students, including myself, gathered to address a large issue in our community, particularly our high school. The disparity between high school graduates and college admissions. By fundraising nearly $30,000 in a semester, 17 incoming seniors were able to embark on a mythical journey into uncharted territory. A weeklong tour of universities on the east coast highlighted our summer that year. This project was put in the limelight by local officials and encouraged students to apply to out-of-state public and private universities. For my community, this project was a representation of what a minority can achieve through the appropriate handling and execution of academic resources. Since that summer, students of my high school have been able to experience admissions into universities such as Duke, Emory, UPenn, Vanderbilt, NYU, Swarthmore, Carnegie Mellon, and other prestigious institutions. Like in the small business of our community, financial support was able to drastically impact the trajectory of our journeys. ","As I grow and develop as a student and professional, I seldom limit myself to new experiences. This has resulted in an acquisition of diverse perspectives through both a cultural and academic lens. During times of uncertainty, I can fall back on previous interactions to arrive at timely and effective solutions. Most recently, while working with my consulting team, in an externship with PWC, I was able to propose a solution to our client team through unorthodox practices involving my knowledge and personal experiences with our target customer segment. When tackling arduous circumstances, creative approaches supported by my cultural perspective have resulted in improved outcomes and led to higher resonance with both my collaborators and audience. In a post-pandemic economy, it is imperative to harness the impact of creative decisions to ameliorate the impact of suffering markets across the globe, and in that sense, expand on our understanding of cultures. ","The challenges of my community propelled me to seek a better life at a young age. Unimaginable living conditions, seasons of harsh economic policies, and intense labor markets impacted my immediate community in ways that many only overhear once the ground settles. My humble origins prevent me from taking opportunities for granted and allow me to resonate with individuals that suffer from difficulties imposed on them by the limitless sea of barriers that certain communities battle in our country. My interconnectedness and personal journey between, often misinterpreted, societal classes, enable me to foster and deliver the desired and necessary solutions to individuals and businesses in damaged communities. Often, it is difficult for individuals to unveil the real scars of American communities. My upbringing and current position instill in me the obligation to give back and look out for those that are in the shoes I once was in. ",,2.55,0.297,-0.758,

One of my previous experiences as a social media strategist for a start-up company has fueled my passion in community engagement. In my last year of high school, I had the opportunity to work with the founder of an experiential marketing start-up company Brand Socialite to expand audience and employee engagement through social media. By identifying the current issue of their social media strategy, proposing a completely new framework, and constantly experimenting with new approaches through monitoring weekly statistics, I was able to help double the company’s social media followers and engagement in 6 months. This experience has trained me to think critically and creatively in the process of resolving a problem, and furthered my interest in helping organizations and companies by utilizing my creativity and communication skills. While a lot of the companies are able to afford consulting groups to help them resolve challenges, I recognize that many local small businesses lack the financial capability to afford such services. I believe EIIG can provide me with valuable opportunities to apply my knowledge into real world scenarios in helping local small businesses to achieve their social impacts. ","One project I worked on that I’m passionate about was building a personal branding website from scratch for an UCLA pulmonologist who wants to expand her career outside the medical field. The goal was not only to showcase the client’s achievements in the medical field, but also to draw new engagements to other opportunities in public speaking, interviews, and entrepreneurships. With virtually no experience in website design before, I started from researching the best website hosting, analyzing other similar websites for reference, and presenting all my recommendations to the client weekly. One issue I ran into is not finding a satisfactory font on the website for my client. As a result, I ended up coding the ideal font into the website and making it function without prior CS experience. I spent 2 hours per day during that summer and worked on website building, resource gathering and organization, graphic design, and deliverable presentation to the client for feedback. As a result, I was able to finish my project for the client in 2 months, along with organizing all the online content presence, logo design, and future social media engagement strategies. By working on this project and with the client closely, I gained skill sets that I had never explored before, and realized how creativity and flexibility during a seemingly straightforward project are the keys to my success. Ever since then, I got more passionate in utilizing my technical and soft skills to help individuals and organizations achieve their goals. ","Whenever I encounter a problem, I would always write down my current thought process and the issue I’m experiencing on a notepad. I would then detach myself from my own perspective, and view it as if I’m helping a friend, since I noticed that I would intentionally ignore the limitations in the situation and simply brainstorm all the possible solutions. Besides brainstorming, I also like to draw out a mindmap to organize all the ideas I have and piece them together in various ways for the best solutions. I also like to take in different voices on a matter to inspire myself, such as asking my friends in different fields what they would typically do in my situation. ","A community that shapes an important part of my identity is dancing. Ever since I joined my first dancing lesson in elementary school, I fell in love with the freedom and flexibility I can express myself when performing to various beats and music. As I continued taking dance lessons throughout my high school career, I decided to join the Mulan Dance Team at Emory my first semester of college. I find myself dancing during my most stressful times in college, as I feel that dancing can take me outside of my brain for a second to allow me time to breathe and think stress-free. Through dancing with other dancers in teams, I also learned the importance of collaboration and how to combine different performance styles into a coherent piece.

As a student at the business school, I usually solve problems with integers that are easy to calculate, and I can differentiate which chapter or concepts questions are related and therefore apply the concepts easily. However, at EIIG, I have the opportunity to work with real-world numbers, which are far more complicated and interesting to me. I need to critically consider which functions or valuation methods are appropriate in the calculation process, I believe EIIG would provide me with valuable practices to learn how to apply the knowledge I learned in class to real cases. I am also excited to work with senior members and members with experiences in the club, and I believe the lean team structure at EIIG encourages soliciting feedback and interactive discussions between group members, which is the team-based working environment I’ve been looking for. 

Furthermore, I would like to witness my contribution being implemented in real-life scenarios. During my private equity internship, I conduct research and valuations regarding the firms that fit into the PE firm’s investing criteria. Although I enjoy the process of presenting my research and drafting deal memos, I realized that my work and ideas were rarely implemented. However, at EIIG, I have the chance to actually see my work being implemented. Furthermore, I can witness the growth of businesses and entrepreneurs we helped, and the actual “impacts” of my and my team's efforts, which is highly rewarding to me. ","I was one of the project coordinators at Volunteer Oxford last year, and I was in the education sector where the team worked with Washington Street Community Center. We set up virtual sessions presented by Oxford volunteers each week with WSCC, and members in the sector would need to host and oversee the session weekly and also be involved in presenting sessions and connecting with children at WSCC. 

This program lasted for 3 months, and the team was able to lead and present 10 sessions. I really enjoyed the program and was passionate and proud that I was one of the coordinators. The material sessions presented varied from simple Maths concepts, to introduction to American literature, to art classes. This program meant a lot to me because I formed bondings with children in our community, and I was genuinely proud of our team as we delivered knowledge to them. We helped them to be engaged, improved, and learned something new. 

Furthermore, as I suggested adding a section, “tell me one thing you are grateful for”, at each session, every participant was able to share the grateful things they had in their life, and I believe that was mutually beneficial for both the children and volunteers in the program, and it helped to form more bonding relationships and helped we know to everyone as a person. Therefore, I consider this volunteering experience one of the most important memories I have had so far in college. ","In high school, I worked on a case study and was supposed to present it to a panel of judges. As I attempted to put my presentation on the large screen, I faced some technical difficulties that I was not able to solve. Given there were a couple of people waiting to present, I decided to quickly jot down the most important graphs’ models in my research on the blackboards and started presenting right away. Without the PowerPpoint, I presented like a teacher giving a class: as I explained the results of my research and important data, I wrote down bullet points, drew lines, and marked significant points on the graph to guide my audience as well as myself to make sure the presentation is wholistic and logical. Eventually, I was able to present most of the material I prepared by changing the way I presented and talked. ","I am a member of the Wuhan Night Run Club, and I’ve maintained my membership for over seven years. The club is more than running: when we were running, we would pick up the trash we saw and either put them in the trash bin or recycling station. This community helps to escalate the optimism in my identity as I spend time with a group of people who always show their best energy in the activity. It also taught me to be persistent in things that I enjoy and trigger my passion. The running is held twice a month, and we run more than three miles each time. I always tried my best to squeeze time and join the running because I know this is the community I love and am proud of, and therefore I am obligated to participate and contribute to it along the way.

experience was during a community-service activity with the Chirag Rural Development
Foundation’s initiative called Project Chirag, which aims to provide ‘light for all’. I
participated in this volunteer work along with my peers and we set out to install solar panels
in the village of Khindipada in Dahanu, Maharashtra. The village had no access to electricity,
so we collected and donated money to purchase the materials needed to construct the solar
panels. 
We managed to amass a fund of over $1200, which enabled us to buy 23 solar panels which we installed in 23 different homes. We instructed the villagers about the use and maintenance of the solar panels, how to charge any electronic devices and how to conserve electricity. We also installed bulbs connected to the panels, providing a more widespread and efficient source of lighting compared to the kerosene lamps that were previously used, which caused health problems and provided insufficient lighting. 
At first, interacting with the villagers was a bit difficult due to language barriers, but as we worked together, they slowly warmed up to us, even asking us to sit with them by the lights we had finished installing. 
Looking back, this experience allowed me to understand that helping even a small community can lead to great fulfilment, and that I can make a positive difference in the world by taking action, which is why I want to continue this effort in the future.","Around two years ago, I volunteered to go on a trip to make and serve desserts to approximately 500 children in a rural village in India named Nadukuppam. However, on the day of the event, we realized my team members who were in charge of getting the ingredients underestimated the amount we would need. 
I first communicated the difficulty of calculating the ingredients for such a large group of people based only on assumption to make sure no blame was placed on anyone in the group to maintain cohesion within my group. 
Next, I needed to find a creative solution – I brainstormed and fed ideas to my group to get them thinking, and I eventually proposed modifying the recipe to use less ingredients in each dessert. We got to work, and I regularly offered words of encouragement to motivate my colleagues.
Eventually, we were able to make enough desserts to feed everyone, and I was very happy to see the smiles on all of the childrens’ faces. Making such a large impact and achieving our goal made me proud, which is why I am passionate about this project.

Vipassana is a type of meditation technique that people practice to get out of the cycle of reincarnation and life and death, and achieve peace. Everyone from my mother’s side of the family practices it, so it has been an essential part of my life. However, it wasn’t until last year that I got to truly experience Vipassana for myself. I took it upon myself to undergo one of the 10-day meditation courses offered in the summer. We were not allowed to use phones, talk, or even make eye-contact for the full course. For most of the day, I was left alone with my thoughts, learning to prevent the negative ones from affecting me. After the course, I felt serenity, as well as a sense of accomplishment, lightness and self-understanding.

I’d been visiting her every week for the past few months to sing as a Youth Ambassador for NYC Concerts in Motion. That day, she told me rather nonchalantly, “Evelyn, soon I won't be here, as I will die in that bed of mine.” Shocked, I awaited her explanation. She continued, “It is too painful to move now; I can barely roll around in my wheelchair.” After I gathered my courage to sing for her, I shared the fun I’d had singing around the world, and we bonded over our love for music. Still the cheerful chatterbox that she always was, she went on to tell stories of building her life from nothing to eventually sing on Broadway. 
          With each of her stories, I learned first-hand how the human spirit prevails. Now, whenever I sing on stage, I think about Mrs. Liebman, and her persevering attitude, and I feel  inspired to sing more freely. Mrs. Liebman’s courage in the face of her physical decline gives me the courage to persist even when I’m not sure what lies ahead. Because I heard these stories of resilience from someone who appears so weak and frail, I now have the confidence and resilience to continue singing my heart out and to be brave, just like her.

","Since I was young, I loved both building models and breaking them down. To me, the process of breaking something down is as important as the process of building it. There are so many decisions when something is built and you can understand the reasoning behind those decisions when you break it down.

This previous summer, I worked at a construction company and partook in multiple projects. One of the projects was to take down outdoor dining spaces. This project was just like the model I built as kids, just life-sized. My role in this project was to prepare for the demolition by removing screws and removing loose pieces. 

This experience was impactful because of how applicable the knowledge I learned was. Most of the outdoor dining space was made up of a wooden framework. While tearing it down, I found those decisions that the builders made. In certain places, they added an additional piece of lumber for extra reinforcement. On the roof, they had constructed a huge wooden “triangle” with a pattern to maximize its strength. These decisions were purposefully made because it added benefit to the building.

After this experience, these building decisions are much more apparent to me when I enter buildings. Because I am also pursuing an engineering degree, this experience is that much more valuable.

Driven by my dynamism and my talent I lived a new experience; that of working in a troupe where everyone collaborates for a common project and where I learned to perfect my leadership skills in a new way of interacting and by building healthy genuine relationships and entering in cohesion with the other comedians I discovered what a troop really meant 
Simply ,for me , theatre was a school of life , which I consider in some aspects as a play just in a bigger scale ","During my internship at Peaksource consulting agency , We worked for Nescafé,an instant coffee brand marketed by Nestlé. They were having trouble conserving their market share and requested our services to stop their unfavourable tendency with their concurrents. Based on the analysis of their data we identified a distribution and coverage problem. Then we established a strategy to remedy to it using a monitoring and inventory management software . Nevertheless their board was picky and have systematically requested us to further develop our recommendations throughout previous collaborations . Understaffed and committed to other clients it would have not been possible . 
Therefore I decided to implement our solutions in a sample of stores one week ahead of the presentation. It resulted in higher sales and an efficiency increase that I highlighted while presenting . It was unexpected and played an important role in convincing the board, giving them a taste of our solutions’ effectiveness .","The mindset that  I carry is a mark of my family .Not only I inherited it,I made it mine and it became a fundamental part of who I am.

EIIG’s mission to provide loans to local entrepreneurs who do not have access to traditional sources capital and improving the micro business gap is one I resonate with personally. Being a part of EIIG and able to consult, monitor loans, source entrepreneurs from local accelerators and more would be an enlightening experience. However, this cause would not only be one beneficial to my academic journey but also one that I believe would inspire a more holistic growth.","An organization I created in senior year of my high school is one that I am most Passionate about. Saaya: Emerging from the shadows is a non-profit organization which focuses on promoting the importance of extracurricular activities among underprivileged children. Children studying in slum schools would usually have free time after their school ended and be forced to beg on the streets to help the household income. We formed a team to find a solution to this problem and introduced extracurricular activities after school. We found volunteers visited these school twice for 6 weeks and offered courses such as dance, storytelling, hair styling and cricket.

","One of my key creative accomplishments occurred in my team project for my Marketing class, when I had to increase market share for a new product without increasing our existing marketing budget. I kicked off with some internal brainstorming on how to maximize the use of our resources and be more creative in the way we market. I worked with two other team mates on creating a Branded Hashtag Challenge for our company to promote on Instagram and Facebook. The ultimate aim was to create a community of fans and buzz around the product. Through the challenge we would be able to have customers market our product without the company having to spend more on their marketing budget. The analysis for this tactic proved as evidence of a successful strategy and we were able to solve the company’s problem by thinking creatively.

I was born and initially lived in a metropolitan city in India. Two years after my birth my father moved to a small town in the Northern hemisphere of India which was mostly forest to start his own business. I would often be upset about being away from my cousins and family and resentful towards my dad for the move.

After coming to college, I realized that living in Jaipur had taught me to built a life for myself in different environments and start fresh.",,2.4,0.27,-0.841,
2023-01-27 12:07:39.207,R,,Finance,Sophomore,Asian,Both,"I personally enjoy going to local stores and restaurants because it seems more “exclusive” and “special” compared to chain restaurants and stores .While these local stores seemed exclusive, I have always thought these places had multiple things that could be fixed, including the stores structure, products price, marketing strategies, etc. However, most of these stores that are facing revenue loss probably can’t hire consultants or resources that can help the store develop further.

So I thought to myself that it would be great if someone could help these stores, even for a non-profit.

And, from attending the information session, I realized that EIIG's goal aligned with what I thought was the best idea for local entrepreneurs. While other clubs work with clients like Coca-Cola, EIIG seems to help local, early-stage entrepreneurs who lack sources of capital. Other clients, who have the assets or the resources to hire a team of consultants, do not need college students’ help. Instead, local early-stage entrepreneurs who lack support are the ones who really need help and actually make a change through that support. Not only this, but it was also very appealing that EIIG works on their project for about 3 years. It seemed like EIIG was not only focusing on specific aspects of the company, but the company as a whole. With EIIG’s goal towards clients, unlike any other organization, I think it really cares about a community's success not only through their words, but also through their actions and behavior towards clients.


","While I was cooling myself under the A/C in our office with a cup of ice water, on the other hand, our electric manager came in and said, “Hey guys, we have to go. The A/C at checkpoint #23 is not working anymore.”

Knowing that the checkpoint was outdoors and how hot that day was, I told myself, “I am screwed.”

After an hour's drive with a team of engineers and our manager, we arrived at the checkpoint and encountered the guard who had been standing there without A/C for hours. Because of the amount of sweat he was spilling, I literally thought he had a darker uniform than us.

We quickly got our tools ready and began looking for the problem within the A/C and dissected every parts. Probably after an hour, with sweats all over our bodies, we told the guard, “The A/C should be fine now, you’ve been through a lot today.” Immediately, with a big smile on his face, the guard was repeating, “Thank you!”

I realized that while fixing A/C is not a big deal, for those who desperately need that A/C, it is like finding an oasis in the middle of a desert. If I ask myself of the satisfied moments back in the military, this is that one moment, without a doubt.
","With only 6 engineer members, we had more than 10+ tasks in a week to complete, from installing a water sewer system, fixing a generator, repairing fences around the base, etc.

With the overflowing number of tasks we had, the engineering company commander made my members and I to work from 8AM-7PM. On the bad weeks, we even had to work on Saturdays. When my colleagues and I hit our limits on working over hours for  3 months, we had to tell the commander. Otherwise, we felt that our bodies would get injured due to the meltdownn. After 3 hours of long conversation with our commander and listening to each other's perspective we both agreed on working only until 4PM, but with less breaks in between. I personally don’t think there is a creative way in solving conflicts, but to be upfront and honest with each other.
","Split into two teams, our company was testing which team could finish the controlled demolition quicker in a given time. Team A had individuals who were very good at their own tasks, including carving passages, knotting TNT, and even planting. On the other hand, team B didn’t have individuals like team A, but they have practiced together for a longer time.

Without a question, everyone thought that this was a piece of cake for team A. However, the results showed different. 

Team B finished the controlled demolition 50 seconds quicker than team A. 

While team A had better members, everyone cared about their own task. However, in team B, after individual finished their own task, they helped others.  

I realized that “there is no individual greater than a team.”
No matter how good an individual is, if you are selfish, you will always lose to those working as a team.

However, after a few days of doing research and attending club fairs, I found out that the Emory Impact Investing Group (EIIG) was the ideal choice for me. EIIG, consisting of 100 undergraduates, helps to provide microloans to local entrepreneurs in Atlanta who lack access to capital and aims to close the micro-business gap in Atlanta. When talking to upperclassmen, I realized that EIIG doesn’t only work for small businesses and educates its members about research and micro businesses, but it also creates events for its members so that they can bond with one another and create a social life. As such, I loved the fact that EIIG proposed an opportunity to create a fantastic work-life balance in college, which has proven to be effective while part of the club. As such, some of the commonplaces that are inherent in EIIG  are the acquisition and sharing of knowledge, the development of empathy and service, and the sharing of friendship.","As a research analyst in EIIG, I’ve researched the micro-business gap in the US. I found out that 13 million micro-business employers earn less than $50,000 a year in the US. I've also concluded that the income of micro-business owners has a large effect on employment levels. Additionally, I’ve noticed that the race of these owners directly affects who they decide to hire and therefore, leads to a disparity where black individuals have fewer opportunities to get hired. In fact in the US, there is about a 10% penalty for applying to a job with a distinctively Black name.

In high school, I've done a project with an owner of a small new Indian restaurant. He was essentially a man that uprooted his family from India looking for more opportunities. He initially came for another job, but soon after starting, he and many others were abruptly laid off. With few options, he secured some financing from friends and other loans he could muster to start the restaurant. I saw no matter the insights we could generate, he was unwilling to pick up more liabilities. As such, I've supported him in trying to invest in minor targeted marketing to boost the delivery and take-out channels. 

Through my above experiences, I’ve learned how Business concepts don’t create value for people equally, but that it’s not an inherent defect of Business. Through being an analyst at EIIG, I hope to use ""Business"" as a tool for uplifting communities.","Late high school sophomore year, my mother got a ‘cancer’ diagnosis. When my parents told me, I didn’t know how to react. It was at once the simplest and most confusing word I could’ve heard at that moment. Once my mom moved into the hospital, I soon made a second home there. Seeing my mom struggle made me feel helpless. I made up for it by doing what I could. That summer I became a messenger, a mailman, chef, homemaker, caregiver. Taking on these new roles made me reflect on the existing roles I served. I accepted I wasn’t doing my best in all parts of my life, including my academics. I realized how little time I had been spending with my family, especially looking after my younger sister. The people around me deserved better from me.

So I kept busy. I started reading the news every day. I started praying and waking up early. In addition to visiting my mom daily, I proactively checked up on my sister. That summer I tried to will normalcy by being as helpful as I could be.

This encouraged me to start a tutoring organization for my school (called StudyVSMART) where selected students would be linked to underclassmen or middle schoolers in need, both for academic support and social mentorship. I wanted to provide empathy and service for my school community. Covid presented some challenges to launch this at the scale I hoped, but we did launch this successfully this fall semester. ","My family has shaped part of my identity. They have helped me to be more productive and had changed the way I view life. I remember myself having lots of energy as a toddler, a kind I felt most rooms were too small to contain. I once thoughtlessly climbed a shelf to get my parents their keys and fractured my arm on a slip-and-fall. I also had a lot of curiosity. My parents wondered why, for example, I kept bringing insects home. It started with a centipede I rescued, and I eventually grew fascinated with how much life and organization existed among creatures so tiny. And metamorphosis! I occasionally brought home caterpillars, nonsensically monitoring them to witness them sprout into butterflies. However, after my mom got cancer, I took on new roles that I've never taken before (caregiver, mailman, and chef) and all this changed the way I approach life. ",,2.375,0.258,-0.961,

My elementary school, Pine Crest, had such a diverse mixture of kids who had absent or abusive parents or barely ate at home, including myself. While none of us were aware of it back then, looking back at those times truly shaped the person I am today. Not enough people understand the importance of supporting your community because they have not took the time to put themselves in others' situations. EIIG, in my opinion, is not an organization, but a team of people with a common goal of uplifting the community. That goal is something that I am sure will fulfill me and my peers to a personal level.

Last semester, I was paired with three other research members tasked with finding the impact of sustainability measures on small businesses. At that point in time, I have only had one experience of conducting extensive research, and it resulted in a depressing C for a grade. Personally, our assignment felt familiar yet daunting. Through constructive criticism and collaboration, our team was able to divide up our work and put forth our best effort. While it is true that our end goal was publishing an informative study, the weeks leading up to it left the greatest impact on me. Being able to work with unfamiliar people and develop an positive yet productive synergy between one another is something I am striving for as an analyst.","During my high school years, I volunteered frequently at an organization called Harvest Time International located in Sanford. The organization was a store dedicated to low-income families to purchase everyday products at a largely discounted price compared to large chains such as Target and Walmart. My responsibilities were mostly to keep the store clean, stock shelves, and sort packages in the back. 

Although the work was tiresome and repetitive, the experiences I had working with other volunteers was truly inspirational. Some of the volunteers committed petty crimes and were there to complete their community service requirement. They gave me advice on life and being responsible with money and relationships. I learned about their struggles and how they are determined to make up their past actions. Overall, it was a unique and fruitful experience.
","There is one story that I always think about when asked such a question, and to the average person it would seem quite minor. However, I had a huge moment of personal growth when I ended up fixing my mother's lawn mother. The motor kept stuttering and dying when I tried to start it up. I ended up learning how a motor works and what it needs to keep running: air, oil, and gasoline. After a couple of YouTube videos and finding the ancient manual of the model in PDF format, I got to work. I conducted an oil and gasoline change using some rusty old tools from my father's shed, and I unclogged the air filter with a brush. Although it was not perfect, it worked long enough for my mother to give the lawn a trim before her shift. It was from here my passion for cars and problem-solving grew.","My family would be the community that has had the greatest impact on the development of my identity.

They had just received a bald eagle that they were unable to release into the wild. They wanted to take the eagle on their traveling education programs, but none of their carrying cases were big enough to transport the bird. When I heard this, I volunteered to build one, knowing that both children and adults would be inspired to see such a large raptor. Therefore, I planned the project and led my fellow scouts in building the case. I learned many lessons on how to effectively lead a group. A couple of weeks later, I went to one of the presentations at a park. Once the eagle was taken out of its case, the whole crowd’s eyes opened and I heard one child say “wooow”. That reaction showed me how much of an impact my project made on the community, and it was one of the best feelings I have experienced. While this project might seem small, I now want to be part of an organization that impacts a community like Atlanta in a significant way. EIIG will be perfect for this since it would allow me to help entrepreneurs to succeed and to help raise the standard of living for entire communities. I can’t wait after three years to see the impact that I made on these businesses after the consulting period has finished.","I have been deeply passionate about space for as long as I can remember. From a young age, I was exposed to the space community through conventions where I met many Apollo and Shuttle astronauts. Listening to their stories of walking on the Moon inspired me to dive deeper into the subject and learn as much as I could. I started reading as many space books as I could find at my local library, and I also discovered a space simulator called Kerbal Space Program which unknowingly taught me orbital mechanics when I was only 9 years old.

These activities over the years deepened my love for space. My father and I bonded over our shared interest in the subject, and it was only a matter of time before we got a telescope. We would often observe the Moon and planets, and seeing the rings of Saturn is an amazing sight that never fails to excite me.

My passion for space carried over into my classes, where in 8th grade I attempted to teach my class about orbital mechanics for a project. One of my friends who was in that class became very interested in space from that presentation, and we started to talk about it. He was able to learn about orbital mechanics from me, and started to play Kerbal Space Program as well. Today he is considering an engineering career in space, and whenever there is another rocket launch, he still texts me to talk about it.","I wanted to express my gratitude to my friend Aryan's father, who has always been kind to me. Most people would get a present or wine, but instead I decided to learn how to sing his favorite song…which is in Hindi. To accomplish this, I would listen to the song while trying to read the lyrics. The problem was that I would have to learn the Hindi script. Going down this rabbit hole, I used flashcards to learn every single basic symbol, and then put the Hindi song on 0.25 mode to match the sounds to the symbols. After about 2 weeks of trying, I was able to sing the whole song at full speed. The smile that I put on his face was worth all the effort I put in, and what started as a funny moment inspired me to minor in Hindi at Emory.","I am deeply passionate about pole vaulting. The vaulting community is well-known in the track world as very tight-knit. Vaulting is the most technically difficult event in track and field and vaulters need to overcome the fear of flying fifteen feet in the air upside-down. I would not be able to reach my potential at Emory without the community support. It is very common to see athletes sharing poles, tape, and suggestions with each other. This community is so intertwined that I already knew three of the four vaulting recruits this year. This strong community has already inspired me to give back, as I was captain of my high school track team for three years and coached our pole vault program. It was fun and meaningful to coach fifteen vaulters at that time. I also coached twice at my club’s summer camp, which had around 100 vaulters.",,2.35,0.258,-0.913,

My parents, however, encouraged me to stay open with my field of study, and like many other dads, my dad encouraged me to take economics. I fell in love with this new way of viewing the world, with financial decisions and their impacts at the center of human society. Poorly applied capital left economies in shambles, whereas those who allocated their resources well saw exponential growth. I realized that most people (including myself) do not understand how this process works and as such seek quick fixes that scratch the surface of financial success but in many instances leave themselves worse off. Through EIIG, I want to learn how to create this instrumental change, to create meaningful financial impact that not only benefits me and my peers, but also valuable companies and society as a whole. Financial markets, I believe, are the key to this change and I want to learn the tools to enact them. I want to learn the mechanics of picking and carrying out an investment, as well as gain knowledge about a variety of industries. Furthermore, I know these skills will continue to be valuable throughout my later career, as well as personal life, as someone who seeks out opportunities for mutual benefit and uplifts others with my resources. ","For the past five summers, I have taught archery to 8-12 year olds at a camp. Each summer, I have worked with campers with a wide range of interest and skill levels. Within the first few days of archery, disinterested campers usually switch out, leaving a group who enjoys archery. This past summer, however, campers were no longer able to switch activities, leaving a group of disinterested campers. Specifically one camper who had some mental health problems, which caused safety concerns and disrupted the flow of the class. My fellow counselors and I had to find a way to get her involved in a safe way that didn't disrupt the class. We increased monitoring of her, so she didn't go retrieve her arrows, while others were still shooting. Moreover, we gave her pep talks to feel more confident about shooting and restructured how we taught the material. In the end, all campers actively participated, improving at archery and having fun. Greater community was created within the class and the larger camp. I learned the importance of adapting to seemingly impossible and how to work within a leadership team.","Before high school I watched as much TV as the average person if not more. I did lots of extracurriculars and did well in school, but I still wasted hours a day on my devices. In freshman year English, we read a book called ""Our Town,"" which emphasized how much time people waste in their life. Sure, I may have looked I was ""living my best life"" to the average person, I recognized how much effort still to give. What would happen if I repurposed these couple hours a day into better pursuits? Thus, I set reading and educational goals to replace TV. I almost completed cut out TV and read large volumes of books. The first year, I read 50 books, the second 100, and the third 41. Most of these books were nonfiction, exposing me to classics, philosophy, history, and so much more. I learned how to focus my attention towards an important goal whenever possible and to not waste any of my potential.","Coming to volunteer at my first Special Olympics basketball game, I was amazed by the skills of the athletes, and thus was relieved to be working the clock and scoreboard. Watching dozens of games, I became mesmerized by their talents, despite society saying that they weren't good enough.
More recently, I had the honor of attending an event at the U.S. Capitol commemorating the first global Special Olympics games in Dubai. The reception helped me realize how large of an impact the Special Olympics program has had around the world. 
During my time at Special Olympics, I reflected on the struggles that society continues to place on people who are different from them. I now recognize more outside of my little “bubble” and realize that I can only receive so much exposure through my reading.

Coming from an international school in Hong Kong, I believe my unique international perspective will help shape EIIG. I hope to provide a unique outlook on specific investments. Hong Kong being a major financial hub, I have been able to have exposure to an abundant of markets. Following in my dad’s footsteps, a director of fixed income and equities APAC trading located in Hong Kong, during the pandemic I was able to sit by him everyday, analyzing his computer screens and asking questions.

All throughout high school, I always advocated for migrant workers in Hong Kong. I even went to the extent of founding my own service organization that focused on teaching migrant workers the life skill of swimming. As a competitive swimmer myself, allowing others to learn my sport was amazing but also giving back to the local Hong Kong community was really important to me. With Hong Kong being a very small island, swimming is an essential skill many don’t ever have the opportunity to learn, connecting with the migrant workers in Hong Kong to solve this was essential. It was amazing to see their growth from simply learning to feel buoyant in the water to then being able to swim a lap of freestyle. I am very passionate about this topic and I hope to continue my work at Emory and expand this to help migrant workers here in Atlanta too.","I have expressed myself creatively through stock pitches which I have been able to really enjoy taking part in. With my fixed income team, creating a CVS Fixed Income Stock pitch was difficult yet rewarding. I was able to take a creative approach for making CVS a desirable bond to pitch.

We used charts, graphs, and our own reasonings to effectively solve this.","Community has definitely shaped a part of my identity.

More importantly, I really like the idea of providing microloans to small businesses. Launching a business on your own could be a very difficult thing to do, even if it is a very small one. More importantly, launching a business of your own requires a sufficient amount of money in the first place, which needs to be invested before it can be produced. It is also very difficult for small business entrepreneurs who do not have much money to borrow enough money from banks because they do not have enough credit. So, many times entrepreneurs with ideas lose their dreams because of this. EIIG gives these people a chance to pursue their career and a chance to make changes to the world.

I also became the club president for our club and established a new system of recruiting and hosting activities. I‘ve also started an online course to help more people of my age to see this opportunity and learn the expertise in this competition.

I would try to trace to see what's the roots for the problem and what are the possible solutions I have that can solve them. I'd also make a lists of the factors that I care about from most to least as well as a list of all the advantages and disadvantages of different choices.

The experience of pitching to completely stranger’s organization for money make me braver and the ability to communicate confidently. I learned a lot of skills and knowledge, such as marketing and econ stuff, through the competition. But more importantly, it showed me what I can achieve and who I am. I wasn’t confident at myself back then. I always doubt if I can do something, especially when it comes to something that generally has boys to do.

I love programming and am so happy I stuck with it but there were many times this path felt very isolating and I considering quitting all together. I put thought into it and wanted to make a difference. Not only should girls be encouraged to pursue it but to stay with it. To encourage them to join from a young age and then give them a community of likeminded people would not only get more girls to try stem but to stick with it. ","What I love about computer science is the problem solving thought process. I love sitting with a problem for a while, struggling to get the solution, and then that feeling of accomplishment when you finally get it. Once I realized this is what I loved about the subject, it opened so many doors for me. I realized I could use this thought process in a daily casual matter too. It did not just have to be big Computer Science projects but the new york time crossword or sudoku. This is the thought process that is most intellectually stimulating for me and I try to access it daily.","Girl in stemThe jewish community has played a huge role in shaping my identity. Having this sense of community growing up was always really special to me. My grandpa escaped the holocaust from Poland and made it here by himself. He made it his number one priority to make sure his family would never feel that sense of isolation. As a result I grew up in a jewish town and attended a jewish sleep away camp. Having people in my life with such similar values to me has always made me feel loved and accepted. I have learned tenacity to fight for what you want, but also the importance of love and putting people before yourself.",,2.0500000000000003,0.193,-1.246,

Unfortunately, Oxford College did not have many pre-business students as most individuals were on the pre-nursing or pre-med track. I therefore did not have many chances to share thoughts and ideas with other pre-BBA students. As I graduated onto the Atlanta campus, I decided I needed to have a group of friends with whom I could discuss business internships and similar interests in finance and beyond. After speaking with multiple EIIG members, I was excited to learn that EIIG was not just a group of students interested in the expansive world of business. It was also a family on its own who was willing to help each other and make sure everyone succeeds. I realized this was a group I wanted to be a part of, learn from, and give back whenever possible.","Since high school, I have been dedicated to growing my online sneaker/clothing reselling business on various platforms like Instagram. Amassing around 1400 followers, I managed to build and strengthen relationships with various sellers and buyers. Though the business is a lot more saturated now, back in 2016, it was still a growing industry. Therefore, sneaker groups or group chats amongst sellers have not been formed yet. One of the main ways of buying and selling shoes was through local sneaker meetups. Being from New Jersey, I decided to find groups that were for “New Jersey Locals” or “Bergen County Area Sellers.” Unfortunately, I could not find any. However, since I had already bought and sold with New Jersey buyers and sellers, I had this network of successful businesspeople. I reached out to them and asked if they wanted to join a group chat of local New Jersey sneaker dealers. Luckily, they all happily agreed, and the group chat is still active with many buyers and sellers in the industry today. This experience was important to me because it allowed me to start something new in an area I truly enjoyed being in, while helping others that shared this passion. Since the first sneaker I sold, I fell in love with the art of buying and selling sneakers and developed the dream of opening my own sneaker store. I plan to give a store discount to the first ten people who joined my New Jersey sneaker group years ago. ","The Good Neighbor Orchestra Ensemble and I were preparing for our annual concert held in June for friends and family alongside our weekly performances at various senior centers in Bergen County, New Jersey. Though it was nice to challenge ourselves, the piece our conductor picked out for us was far more difficult than that of last season. As concertmaster, I was responsible to make sure the violins played the piece to the best of our abilities. The first month of rehearsals did not go very far due to the piece difficulty. I decided to host one-on-one sessions with each violinist in my section and then one entire sectional monthly. In this way, not only did we strengthen our relationships, but we also managed to practice our pieces in a much better setting. We focused on each measure without having the rest of the orchestra wait on our behalf. ","I believe the Oxford community has shaped part of my identity; I met diverse people at Oxford. “Y” was easily the nicest person I met. Though some may think “Y” was socially underdeveloped, he taught me that it is okay to not care about what others thought due to him being less aware of social situations. In addition, being an hour away from Atlanta, I learned to make most of the present. I learned that unlike main students, I could not “go out and have fun” every weekend. Going to Atlanta meant an hour-long shuttle there and back plus uber trips. Therefore, I learned to work hard during the weekdays and weekends when I stayed at Oxford so that those days where my friends and I did go out felt much more exhilarating, exciting, and worthwhile. This value of “work hard, play hard” has since been a part of me. ",,2.0,0.186,-1.247,

The owner, James, was an old-school Korean immigrant in his sixties who enjoyed working alone. After getting to know James, he expressed his worries about whether he could retire, if he could save up enough to purchase his own home one day, and if his business could even survive the pandemic. Though I was initially hired as a receptionist, I wanted to see how I could help James. What started out as a summer job quickly became a year-long passion project. Over the next year, I implemented automated text reminders to scheduled customers and charged a $15 deposit at the time of reservation. Appointment no-shows dropped by more than half. I learned installation techniques and helped James install tint. The extra hand cut the average installation time from three hours to just over one. Even though I knew I would not receive any portion of the tips, I began to simply mention to customers “tips are not required but always appreciated.” Tips increased by eightfold. After a year, revenues had increased by 52%. At the end of 2021, James submitted an offer for his first home. Through EIIG, I want to continue making a difference to small businesses who are in need of even more help. I want to join EIIG because it strives to make a real difference in our community rather than simply offering another line on the resume. ","My father is a pastor and counselor who provides assistance to struggling families through the church. As such, our entire family is deeply involved in his ministry in our own respective ways. While my father provides counseling to the adults, I lead the youth group of children ranging from ages 5-20. Many of them are children of single parents, immigrants, and struggle with mental health and finding their own identity. One particular teen had just moved to the US from Korea, and was struggling with harsh bullying and depression. As a mentor, I try to provide a sense of belonging and inclusion for youth like her- and it is immensely rewarding to see them grow more comfortable opening up with their peers. I believe that no job or accomplishment is worthwhile unless it leaves the world better than we found it- and that is my way of contributing to that cause.","When I was applying to universities, I was stuck on one question in particular. On the application for Wake Forest University, one question stated “please make a top ten list of anything of your choosing.” While my other friends deliberated over this question for hours, thinking “what kind of list should I make to make myself sound smarter/ more impressionable/ knowledgeable?” I instead realized I have been living with an answer my entire life. I simply ranked my ten fingers in the order that I preferred them. The first was my right hand index finger, and in last place was my left pinky- absolutely useless. Though I was not intentionally trying to be funny or creative in any way, I think it served the purpose of creatively expressing my easygoing nature. ","The most important community in my life has been my family and church. Although I am a “pastor’s kid,” I am not religious. Still my church has been a hub of communal support and inclusion which I rarely see elsewhere. When one family struggles, the others chime in to help- whether it’s financially, emotionally, or spiritually. We will bring each other homemade food on Sundays and take turns hosting potlucks. We take care of each others’ children. We help each other by connecting them to potential job opportunities. This is the spirit I would love to bring to Emory too, where people may find it harder to form that community. In my opinion, everyone can benefit from looking out for each other and being each other’s advocate. ",,1.975,0.181,-1.261,

Our business buys returned products from various vendors and resells them online. I helped come up with the idea, but more important I helped with the execution. Having an idea is the easiest part, the real challenge is making that vision a reality. I was contacting various vendors almost everyday seeing if we could purchase any of their returns. In the end, I was able to create a good connection with a vendor and we still do business with them today.

Starting my business with my 2 friends was one of the most important experiences I have ever had. The most important thing I learned was to be okay with failure. There were a few vendors that we bought some product from and we just have not been able to sell them. We still hold them in inventory today. However, it's important to realize that not everything will go your way and there's nothing wrong about that. At the end of the day, failure is still something scary. However, this experience has allowed me to become more comfortable with it.","As a college student, I have found that one of the most effective ways to solve any problem is to remain calm and composed. When faced with a problem, I begin by identifying the needs and wants of those affected by the problem, and then brainstorming different ideas and solutions. This allows me to think outside of the box and come up with unique and effective solutions. Additionally, when calm, I'm able to think very clearly and there is always a solution.","My family has shaped a massive part of my identity. Family is the most important aspect of my life.

I also viewed this primarily as an opportunity to gain experience working in this type of environment with extremely resourceful people with tangible skills. Through this opportunity, I am essentially giving back to the community and gaining crucial intel on the structure of this type of non-profit business. This grants me a hands-on experience to helping people by building strong relationships with them. ","I was apart of a Habitat for Humanity project where my group had to construct a 3D model of a house sustainable for a family of 3-4. It was extremely fun because we were able to create our ""ideal"" house while adhering to the requirements they instituted for the rules of the contest. Surprisingly, my group won! We constructed a 3D model of a house that appeared sufficient and stable enough to house a low income family. This was an extremely important project to me because I come from the very backgrounds of the people we were ""building"" the house for. Upon hearing the guidelines, I immediately placed myself in their shoes and imagined a house filled with convenient appliances and access. All the things that were not available to me was intentionally placed into that house, so I held it very close to my heart. ","One way I have been able to express myself creatively to solve an issue is by writing stories eerily similar to the predicament I am in at that time. It helps me understand the key players  and values in a tense situation, and how I could appropriately respond given the consideration of all of the factors around me. A lot of the times I can even get to a solution by fulling playing out the story, which obviously helps me reach a conclusion of my own in the long run. Writing is one of the first outlets for me since it is extremely therapeutic and effective. ","A community that has shaped a part of my identity would be my theater group. I was, sort of still am, very introverted and closed off to people. I had a personality but I didn't know how to properly channel it, so I would just marvel at everyone else who was able to do that. They helped me slowly reveal parts of my personality that others would have found appealing all along if I just knew how to express it. They helped me with jokes, comedic timing, acting dramatically and excessively, all of the above when it comes to the skills you gain playing around in theater.

I want to be able to apply what I learn in my Organization and Mangement class to real life examples. The mission behind EIIG aligns with my personal morals. I want to make an impact. I have been a supporter of social impact since I was young through my passion for worldwide public education to everyone, regardless of gender, social class, age, etc.  I am passionate about worldwide available education because of the lack of education in Indian slums. My whole family lives in India and my parents were born and raised in rural India. I got to hear firsthand about their experience with the lack of education. My parents had to move away from their family, to the United States, for a proper education. Education is not readily available to everyone in India, which is sad. Additionally, my passion comes from a non-profit my aunt runs called the Seed Foundation. She provides scholarships and runs a school for children who live in the slums of India. When I visited the foundation, many years ago, I got to see the passion kids had for education. Education is very important, especially for children in the slums of India. Knowing my grandparents did not have the opportunity to get educated and my parents struggled to get a proper education in India makes me passionate about worldwide education. I would love to make an impact that could possibly change the lives of kids, women, and small businesses forever.","A project I was involved in that I was passionate about would be the non-profit Seed Foundation that I was able to visit. Knowing that my aunt was the founder made me even more passionate about it. When I was younger, I got to spend time in India where I visited the Seed Foundation. This place was a mini school that would foster kids love for school. It would make me passionate to see the amount of passion each kid had behind learning. It made me realize how lucky I was to be able to have education readily available to me just minutes away from my house. Again, this is passionate to me because my whole family is from India. My own grandparents were not fortunate enough to go to school and learn english. This made it very hard for me to communicate with my own grandparents. After having this barrier it made me realize that people are not as fortunate to have education. I got to help read to some of the kids and try and teach them how to write in english. I got to play with the kids during recess. Many of the kids were so happy to see me act like a mentor. This was a life changing experience that opened my eyes to the reality of the world we live in. ","I was able to express myself creatively when I worked at Graydon Pool over the summer. We had a shelf of iced teas and my boss asked me to come up with a way to sell the iced teas. I was able to increase the sales for homemade iced teas that were not selling by creatively discounting the price by giving two refills for one. This allowed for us to sell the iced teas and make some money from it. The two for one meal deal enticed the customers to buy the iced tea because they were getting two cold iced teas for the price of one. On a hot summer day in June, that deal sounded amazing to all.

Ridgewood is not a diverse town so I went to elementary, middle, and high school with people that did not looked like me. I always felt left out because I was Indian and brown. I had to get myself included and make friends in this culture where there were not many that looked like me. My parents did not grow up with this culture so it was hard for them to comfort me when I felt excluded. I did eventually have to overcome that struggle and learn to love myself for who I was.

I want to learn more about the stock market, so that I can start investing my own money and helping the Emory community. I want to learn how to perform statistical analysis and machine learning to predict future trends in the stock market.

","I love Sports Analytics. One day I hope to pursue that as a career. While I was in high school, I had the opportunity to do a three-year science research project on the topic of my choice. I chose to do a project evaluating lineups in the NBA. I was able to run regressions in excel and optimize lineups to see which lineups were most efficient. I created shot charts in R-studio for the most optimal and least optimal lineups and I made graphs to visualize all my data in Tableau. It was an awesome experience and all of the skills I gained from that experience have all been relevant to my work as a college student right. I also had to read at least twenty peer reviewed research papers that have helped me learn a lot about the field of sports analytics. I participated in competitions and was recognized as one of the top 10% of participants. I got to write research papers and after I finished my project, I decided to give back to the community and become a mentor for a peer’s project.","I love to solve problems. I believe that a problem can be solved in many ways, and everyone solves it differently. As Harvey Spector says, “When you have a gun point to your head, there is a million ways to get out of it”. When I am tasked with a problem, I try to use my own skills to solve it in a way I know makes sense. For me, that way is through math and logic. I try to use logic as much as I can when I am tasked with hard problems in life. I lay out the pros and cons of each decision, write down all of my options and run a simulation in my head to see which way is most optimal. Each decision you make will have ups and downs. So I give each output a weight and choose the most optimal solution.","The Jewish community as really been a great backbone for me to lean on. Although as a scientific person I have always expressed doubts in my religion, I always have been a huge supporter of the values that the Jewish community believes in. I don’t think that you must believe in God to be a part of a religious community. Because I believe in holding all of the responsibilities of a good Jew. I may not fast on Yom Kippur, but every day, I try my best to be a good person and I work hard and prioritize my education. The stereotype that Jews are cheap or that they love money comes from the ideals that are passed down from generation to generation.",,1.6666666666666667,0.118,-1.55,

For a period of time, I see marketing as my future career. However, when being a marketing intern in high school, I realized I want to be able to work in a career that allowed me to think critically about a business, and its strategy both from qualitative and quantitative angles after doing research about different companies. As a freshman who wants to do investment banking as a future career, I know that joining an investment group is the best way to learn about this career and gain technical skills. Besides gaining an understanding of investment banking, joining EIIG will also have the opportunity for me to make connections with mentors and work with peers of similar interests which gives me a more holistic view of finance. Working with small businesses is another exciting part for me. Besides learning technical skills, having the opportunity to work hands-on is always the best way for me to learn other professional skills, such as communicating with clients and delivering ideas. Finally, the main and most important reason that EIIG stands out to me among other investment clubs is its mission. I think by joining EIIG, what’s valuable for me is not only having an opportunity to grow as an analyst but also to make meaningful impacts on others in the community.","Since the beginning of this year, I internship as a private equity analyst at JHMacon Capital. This is my first internship experience as an analyst, but I already developed a lot of passion for this position. As an intern, my task was to do research on companies that fits the criteria and write personal emails to the prospects. The process of outsourcing really helped me to have an understanding of the responsibility as an analyst, which is very important to me. In addition, I am also responsible for delivering five prospects to JHMacon Capital’s CEO each week. Being able to share my findings and communicate my personal thought on each company to the CEO really made me feel like I am contributing to JHMacon. My work provides a list of prospects for the CEO to contact, and I am happy that I can be part of this investing process. ","One way I have been able to solve problems creatively is through compromising and conducting effective communication. I am a programming member of the Oxford Chinese Student Association at Emory. During Halloween, the programming members are divided into two groups and each group was asked to come up with one haunted house idea. The club’s original idea was to build two different themed haunted. However, due to budgeting reasons, we were only able to build one. The programming chair suggested giving up one group’s idea. But I suggested combining two groups’ projects because I don’t want anyone’s hard work to go wasted. During the negotiation process, I wrote out a clear proposal and present it to the elective board. Finally, the negotiation was successful with the proposal, and I’m glad that I can use my creativity and communication skills to combine two haunted houses with different themes into one. ","One community that shaped part of my identity is my high school. I attended a boarding high school in California for the past four years. My high school has taught me many things: to have the courage to fail, to think critically, to give back to the community, and many more. But most importantly, it taught me to always be open-minded, which has shaped part of my identity. In my high school, our humanity classes were composed of interdisciplinary studies. Being exposed to different ideas and having the opportunity to have discussions with classmates from different backgrounds, I realized I can learn more by being open-minded. My creativity was also fostered by having an inclusive mind. Therefore, even as I left high school and go on to college, I always remember being open-minded as a person because it leads me to creative solutions and abundant opportunities. ",,1.5,0.081,-1.741,

The next day, after discussing with my co-workers, we went up to my manager, proposing that a loyalty reward program in the form of stamps would be highly beneficial to the business to boost customer retention. 

Truth be told, when I applied to be a barista at a local Korean cafe in Oklahoma, I solely wanted to learn the art of making coffee. Instead, I got out something much greater.

However, even though I quickly comprehended the logistics of statistical tools in R package, I was at a profound loss. Struggling to understand this extensive enterprise as a whole, I began to reach out to graduate students who were seemingly irrelevant to my task. As we shared demonstrations of extracting DNA from soil samples and sequencing 16S rRNA genes, I conceptualized how their biological intricacies were precisely quantified and explained to them the specific parameters I use for a more standardized data layout. 

Despite spending less time at my own desk, the moment of fruition came much sooner- an arrow representing permafrost thawing duration elongated across the graph, unveiling an underpinning affecting Alaskan soil microorganisms. My eyes glowed with fascination. As I almost soaked into the computer screen too far, I quickly gathered everyone across the lab. Indeed, this was a joint effort from molecular biologists, engineers, lab technicians, and data scientists, all integral in a collaborative fashion.

Wanting to help him out, I started playing ping-pong with him one-on-one the next day. Still, I noticed that his movements were stiff and his face was filled with shame whenever he lost a point. I immediately started showing him my signature snake shot, hitting the ball under the table. As he reached for the left, the ball casually bounced to the right corner. The room echoed with peals of laughter. 

Gradually, I was able to introduce him to my friends, and his face was painted with a beam of sunshine. He was now one of us, who I proudly call my friend.

While building a treehouse may not be a skill I can use in everyday life, especially here in Atlanta, I have continued to exercise my carpentry muscle by volunteering with Emory Habitat for humanity every chance I get. ",,"One community that has shaped a part of my identity is the New York Mets community. My family has always rooted for the Mets, but, before coming to college, my association with the mets would be primarily hearing the sportscast coming from my Dad's room, or watching postseason games if they made it that far. Freshman year, while I adjusted to my new life here at Emory, I became a little homesick. Having lived in New Jersey most of my life, I was having a hard time adjusting to my new life here in Atlanta surrounded by people who had backgrounds that I couldn't relate or connect to. I soon realized that watching a Mets game gave me the ability to connect back to where I came from. It transported me back for a little while each game and helped me find something I could have pride in. Seeing other people on campus wearing Mets gear makes me see just how big this community is and makes me feel less alone. The people I have met from this community are all vastly different, ranging from age to interests and even personal beliefs, but the one thing we all have in common is our love for the New York Mets.",,0.0,VOID,VOID,

","During my senior year of high school, I was the student liaison for The Collective of Concerned Black Professionals: an organization composed of members who are dedicated to enacting positive acts of change in communities all over the United States. While conducting research for the CCBP, I noticed that the pre-register to votes rate for my county was much lower than its surrounding communities. After weathering the effects of the 2016 election, I became acutely aware of what was at stake with the upcoming election; it compelled me to fully commit myself towards boosting this rate.Over the course of a couple months, I collaborated with my county's school board to organize an event that enunciated the importance of voting for my peers and provided a platform with which students could raise concerns they held about the institution. A plethora of students filled out voting pre-registry forms at the event and I was proud that I was able to make a difference in my community. I am passionate about this outreach because it allows disenfranchised individuals the opportunity to speak truth to power, participate in cultivating an empowering community, and increase accessibility for future generations to comfortably cast their ballots. The voting system offers underprivileged and marginalized people of America a platform from which to speak their views. When the underrepresented vote, an additional degree of perspective is added to the political conversation.
","Throughout high school, I was one of my school’s environmental proctors who were tasked with leading weekly informational sessions to raise awareness for environmental problems persisting within our school’s ecosystem. The biggest issue that we had to tackle was our school’s egregious trash problem; trash bins in hallways consistently overflowing with items that could be reused or recycled. The environmental team and I decided to contact a local farm to implement composting bins all over our school’s campus. These bins were collected once a week and had our school’s waste converted from organic material into soil fertilizer that could be used for the local farm’s crops. I wanted to motivate my schoolmates to use these composting bins instead of falling back into their old habits, so I proposed the idea that we molded each composting bin into a different sport. I designed the composting bins to imitate basketball hoops and other bins having mini-hockey sticks attached to them where the bin resembles a hockey goal. It was a really innovative project that collectively made our school more environmentally conscious and responsible.","During my short time on Emory’s Oxford Campus, I was able to meet a great community of people through the campus’s Black Student Association. I met an extensive amount of students who shared similar childhood experiences with me even though we all grew up in different parts of the world. It was encouraging and reassuring to know that I was not alone in experiencing first-hand racism throughout middle school and high school from attending predominantly white schools. I loved how the BSA community was able to create events around coming to terms with past traumatic experiences through the means of  providing spaces for students to talk through their traumatic experiences — whether it be racism, sexism, abuse, etc.— to mentally grow and comes to terms with them.",,0.0,VOID,VOID,
